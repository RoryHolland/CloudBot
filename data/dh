My new keyboard has arrived
It's still sliding on my desk though
I think it's just a slippery laminated desk
I'll try it at home and make sure it's not wobbling at home because that's where the problem was most noticeable on my other keyboard
rory:I think this one is probably fine :)
I'll check it at home just to be sure, then send my other one back to Amazon tonight
rory?
yay my new keyboard is not wobbling on my desk at home ^^
I guess I just got a faulty model last time then
I'll send it back some time this week, when I am not busy/CBA
Might wait for the weekend
I have until the 27th I think
I love typing on my new keyboard
I keep accidentally alt-tabbing out of games though....
This one is even better, because it doesn't wobble on the desk
The part of the office where I work is near IT support, so it's fairly noisy there so nobody minds it
CBA with shitty Chinese pay2win games
Yes?
It's just weapon skins, and there's no lvling and no content behind a paywall
Same as Dota
All weapons, all heroes, all content is available at the start
omg shit like this is why I hate white girls https://twitter.com/KristiLeskinen/status/693863192900927488
What a stupid fucking white bitch
Smurfing is dumb, IDK why people want to do that
Dota MM puts me against VERY good players every game
5k mmr
It's basically the Dota equivalent of LoL Challenger
What rank are you?
What rank is that?
Ah I think that's about 200 mmr in Dota
http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/New+lol+system_0ccb64_5286183.png
wtf what's with the spike at 4k
You gotta factor in the skill differences
Diamon 1 in LoL is like 2k mmr in Dota
The amount of skill you need to reach your rank is about the same as the amount of skill you need to reach 200mmr in Dota 2
Actually, I lied I'm 5.2k mmr which is 99% percentile
Most people just round it to the nearest 1k
I don't have enough time to play seriously, so I just play a casual game or two a night
I'm 20th best in the world with Phantom Lancer
67% winrate in the last 12 months
68%*
Over 230 games
Na, I don't give a shit about mmr
I'll never be a pro, don't have time
Maining heroes is dumb
You suck if you can't play all of them semi-decently
You need to know the limits of every hero to play against them all effectively
Climbing sure
Everyone knows hhow to play a few well
But high mmr does not equal skill
brb eating dinner
back
Playing the same hero over and over is not fun and doesn't make you a better player
I don't even care about my mmr
I don't care that I'm 99th percentile in a really hardcore game
I just play for fun
I think CS:GO is going to dominate western esports pretty soon
It's amazing how it's the third largest esport right now, yet it doesn't have an Asian scene at all
Implying that all 18 year olds went to war, and all 18 year olds today like My Little Pony

Shit, I spilled cream soda on my new keyboard...
Annyoung rory
Iota-work:I love my new keyboard I got yesterday
Iota-work:But I spilled cream soda on it :(
Iota-work:I drink Sugar Free cream soda
I met my gf on okcupid.
It was only a little bit on the side, and I was mid-game
Are mechanical keyboards easier to clean?
What keyboard do you use now? My K65 brushed aluminium is so sexy
rory:What do you think of my K65? Do you like it?
It's kinda deep for a tenkeyless...
It's big
Lots of metal
Yeah but I've seen other keyboards with the same amount of buttons but much smaller
No, a lot of them don't have any added bezel
But mine has big metal bezels
rory:It's a really premium feel, but a bit larger on the desk
wow people buy you mechanical keyboards for your birthday? All I get is shitty clothes that take up space in my wardrobe but I never wear
My parents don't support my gaming
rory:lmao
My dad just gives me £50 and I give him £50 back
In China they give money for the new year
Are you doing anything to celebrate the new year?
rory:wtf
Don't be racist please
I have black pupils
.wa lunar new year
Iota-work:So Windows 7 and 8.1 users get it for free automatically?
Iota-work:Does that mean that our work PCs will be W10 soon?
lmao
$31b holy shit
Iota-work:lmao so it's basically a f2p microtransaction model?
But there is so much free quality software on PC
And they have to compete with Ubuntu's app store which is 99% free
Steam has an app store now too
Why are programs called apps nowadays?
lmao
IDK it feels like "program" should be the correct word
It's called "programming" for a reason otherwise it would be "applicationing"!!!!!
I don't have a seedbox because I am poor :(
£70
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Corsair-CH-9000040-UK-Vengeance-Performance-Mechanical/dp/B00DOTQ15M/
It feels like it's built like a tank
What? Why?
wtf really?
rory:How?
No, I only like good music, like kpop
wtf we use a lot of web-based systems which don't work properly in Chrome and the Javascript only works in IE WTF
rory:I like Firefox too
But Chrome came preinstalled on my work PC
Yeah Chrome has proprietary window decorations and theme wtf
Why doesn't it just integrate with GTK wtf
Also, Firefox has a bigger addons library
Although I use the Steam Inventory Helper which is Chrome-only....
But Firefox struggles really hard when I have 300+ tabs open
Iota-work:wtf?
But I can't sell all my shit in one go without it....
It's too much manual work
The new compendium is SERIOUSLY good
So many quests!
So many hats!
I'm going to sell all my shit I make from the quests and use it to buy some games on Steam
Did you see that video on the top of /r/all of those two American guys who snuck into the cinema as one person?
It was so funny omfg
They looked like one really fat man hahahahhaa
Except it was all belly fat
hjahahahhahahahhaha
lmao
I wonder if they'll get arrested for committing a crime and posting the evidence on Youtube
I wonder if Google will take the video down for criminal
Iota-work:wtf no, the crime was done before the video was even uploaded
It is illegal to sneak into the cinema, right?
Do you get paid lunch?
omg
My friend plays LoL and he had the same keyboard as I do now, but he destroyed it by smashing it on his desk because he was raging
Well I am paid on salary too, but I am contracted to work 37 hours a week, not including a mandatory 30/60 minute break each day
So I'm pretty much paid per hour
I go to the gym in my lunch hours now ^^
And I get a personal trainer twice a week
£5 a month for my gym, including two personal trainer sessions a week
0 travel time
Sounds like a good deal?
I wasn't even paying anything for the first 10 months
of course it's subsidised
I already have a car
omg my colleague next to me is snoring and it's so distracting
She is awake
She's day-snoring
Why do people have to breathe so loudly omg
IDK probably
Emotional loss?
What
I always ask
I like getting
Helps me with my poverty a bit
Then you don't need to buy a bag?
Are there any free items you can buy or under 5p that you get a free bag for?
haha I used to do that in Wales
CBA with self service because they always fuck up and I have to wait for a person to come and un-fuck up the machine
PLEASE REMOVE BAG FROM BAGGING AREA
lmao
Well I bring my own bag if I plan on going, but just pay 5p or carry in my arms for impromptu visits
5p isn't much
lmao that's too funny m9
they seriously think the supermarkets are charging for bags to make more money?
God they're so stupid
do you live in chavtown or something?
Do they not realise that the supermarkets have purposefully been giving away free bags for decades in order to increase sales?
And that charging for bags actually hurts them?
lmao
my mum flipped her shit when she found out I "wasted" 5p on buying a  supermarket bag instead of taking my own
was so funny
I don't carry a bag around with me all the time in case I go to the shop
lmao
wtf why is everyone in my team female
I'm one man working with like 10 girls
Procurement
lmao no
HR is for girls
housing
Lots of men, lots of girls
well yeah
You wanna be an engineer
lmao
Sorry I can't agree with you right now because I am at work and we have anti-discrimination policies and shit
I have a vote for what?
I don't vote
I don't believe in party politics, it doesn't seem very democratic to me
I already know with at least a 50% certainty who is going to be the next prime minister
Either the labour or the conservative leader ofc
Always
Every fucking time
Never changes
It's so rigged
The voting system is pretty obviously flawed
It's not proportional at all
Won't work
They'll never get into power
Even if on the freak chance they make a deal to share it with one of the big two parties, they will have their attempts ruined
It's factually correct, it happened a couple of years ago
Actually, the winning party is only voted for by about 20% of the population
Lib Dems wanted to change it, they got to be a big party, and they failed
They had to compromise with the conservatives to go with Alternate Vote instead of Proportional Representation
And if there was proportional representation, they wouldn't get 37% votes,  and would get FAR less seats
The amount of seats in parliament is HUGELY manipulated by the inefficient voting system, favouring the parties in power which don't want to change
We have an inefficient political equilibrium
I'd vote for him if he changed his last name to Thornberry
Only because it currently benefits them
Because they got a way higher proportion of votes than seats
Because market incentives are almost always stronger than political principles
nice!
Not quite
I think everyone believes in electoral reform unless they're uneducated on it
The current voting system is just inefficient, there's no denying that
It is unrepresentative, I'm sure David Cameron and David Milliband are aware of that
I'm sure David Cameron knows that current voting system is unrepresentative
But he doesn't support PR because then he might not get to be PM
So it's not very democratic really
Yeah but I don't know how to spell Jeremy Corbin
Why can't they just pick easy names, like Tony Blair and David Cameron
And George Bush
I like Jeb Bush the most
I guess they don't feel like having a third Bush president
It's an AMAZING fucking coincidence that a son of a president also became a president, and his younger brother might become one too!!!!!!
AMAZING
If I didn't know any better, I'd say it was rigged
Then why doesn't it work for prime ministers too?
GYM TIME BE BACK LATER
yay I'm alone for the next hour
Nobody else is here today except for everyone not in my team
I wish all keyboards were mechanical
My keyboard was easy to clean last night because it has an open brushed aluminium base ^^
And the few keys that were affected were very easy to remove and wipe too
Much easier to clean than a standard office keyboard haha
It's much smaller than a standard office keyboard, but much heavier
So it feels much better built
Do you think some keyboard manufacturers might be putting weights inside the board to give a false impression of high build quality, like Beats does?
Iota-work:No but they make headphones and put weights inside them
Should I do cardio today?
I feel like I should do cardio at least once a week
CBA though because it will take up a timeslot for lifting
I don't have time for work, exercise, Dota, AND GF
Stupid work takes up way too much time lmao
wtf 20 minutes every fucking day?
Oh no, I think I use SwiftKey
All mobile keyboards suck, including Swiftkey
wow you sound like a fucking nerd m9
wtf is T9
ffs I keep accidentally holding a key down on my new mechanical keyboard
LMAO
Are you a virgin?
I use my body as a weight
lmao
lmao
wtf
lmao
Iota-work is a fucking troll
lmao
I'm gonna do some lifting I think#
Annyoung rory
wtf how?
wtf why do you stay in 3 hotels a week?!?!?
That is so expensive!!!!
I hate it when my gf visits me because my parents don't let me have girls to stay over, and the hotel is fucking expensive
You can do things in hotels you can't normally do
bookings.com is a big one for hotels
lmao I'm cold every day m9
lmao no
I wish
I'm freezing my balls off every day m9
I just bring my coat to work every day
I don't get paid until the 27th and I don't have enough money for this month...
Got that cash flow problem....
I might ask my dad if I can borrow a couple of hundred pounds
 But I have a feeling he'll tell me to just ask my mum to delay my rent
Then my mum will tell me no
No, it's called not having any income for two months and an increase in rent
If I have to, I'll just take money out of my monthly saver
I'd just prefer not to
I would be fine if it wasn't fucking Valentine's Day in 2 weeks
Fuck that holiday so much
It's literally bankrupting me
Got to go to Brighton and buy my gf lots of shit
She is already Korean
She reminds me every day
lmao old man steve just told me that Wikipedia is a bad source because anyone can edit it
I'm pretty sure I understand Wikipedia and referencing better than old man steve
What should I order? http://www.thebridgeinnathorton.co.uk/uploads/5/7/2/7/57274237/new_menu_winter_15_pdf.pdf
I remember last time I got the Chargrilled Chicken breast smothered in BBQ sauce,
mature cheddar and smoked bacon, served with chips
and a lightly dressed salad but I still wanted more....
I might get it anyway and eat my colleagues' leftovers too as a possible bonus
I am paying
Yeah that burger looks nice!
TLDR?
Iota-work:lmao
That sounds so cruel, fucking over people who cannot manage their finances just to entertain the population
Iota-work:The sensible people will be edited out ofc
Well I guess the money up-front would actually be beneficial if they know what they're doing. They have the money guaranteed instead of DWP fucking up, they can earn interest on it, can make any long-term upfront payments, etc
Of course, the sort of people getting this money often won't have the same thoughts as I do
Before I even put my salary into my current account, I put half of it into my pension and mortgage deposit
I treat it as money that I am not allowed to spend
I put in 7% of my salary into my pension, and my employer puts 10% in
I put £200 into my help to buy ISA, £300 into my First Direct monthly saver, and £250 into my TSB monthly saver
LMAO
I don't spend much on drugs and takeaways
I spend a lot on gaming though
IDK man
I spent over £1000 on my PC
wow
Why?
I probably spend just as much on gaming as you spend on drugs
Do you ever feel like it's too early to go home, but you don't have enough time to really start doing anything?
whatever im going home
thanks m9
I keep accidentally holding a key pressed on my keyboard without noticing omg
45g of actuation force is so low!
I can have my finger holding down a button without even noticing!
Yeah because MX Red is best for gaming
Well wouldn't a 25g switch be better then?
IDK m9
wtf is non-linear
what a bout browns, blues, blacks, whites, etc?
Blues look best for typing
I wanna bring an MX Blue into the office and write a big letter or something hahahahhaha
I am worried I will be resentful of my gf when I visit her because I won't be able to do my daylies :(
Do you know how club draws work?
For a payment of £1 per week, equating to £4.50 deduction from your monthly salary, you can choose an available number which will then be yours for the duration.
  41 / 134 / 136 / 143 / 149 / 152 / 156
If you would like to choose one and send me an email back with authority to deduct the £4.50 from your salary, I can then forward to people services for deduction from the next available date and you will be in with a chance to win in each monthâ€™s draw, which at present issues 11 prizes per month with extra amounts at Christmas and Easter depending
 on how much excess we have at the time.
Any excess money over the year not used for the draw will then be donated to charity at year end.
Do you think I can make a profit from it?
Yeah
wtf?
Fuck that
Yeah but what am I likely to win?
hahahaha yes I love that but I still have to pay student loan on it :(
138 people are participating, does that mean I have 1/138 odds of winning?
5 prizes, £125, £75, £50, £25 and £10
11 draws
Monthly
Looks like it's 1X£125, 1X£75, 2X£50, 4X£25 and 3X£10 each month
but X11
1/138 X11
1/138 odds X 11
Because it's 11 draws
6.587615283267457e-4%
brb working now
0.000658762
says excel
(0.7246376811594203*11)/11=0.72463768115=72.46% chance of winning
Does my maths check out?
My team is so weirdf
They are always talking to themselves
Kinda creepy really lmao
Iota-work:Why?
I just did a big tender for a three year mobile contract for my company
O2 was one of the ones we were considering
I pay like £5 a month for my mobile lmao
I'd probably pay less if I could find one with just data
I want a pay as you go for calls and free data pls
lmao how high was he?
Oh wow that's cheap for unlimited data!
It sucks that you have to pay £30 for it now :(
I find 500MB is fine if I just don't look at any videos or music or download anything
Iota-work:I mainly just use it for traffic in google maps, and WhatsApp
And some Reddit
So mainly just text really
Very light stuff
I download my maps on Google Maps, downloaded my songs on Spotify
And just don't watch videos on mobile
.I
Spotify is £5/m for me
I get 5% cashback on all contactless payments
I have 3,333 songs saved on my phone, but stupid Spotify won't let me save more
Well most shops I go to don't accept contactless, so I can't max it out anyway
I have a 200GB MicroSD card in my phgone
Only using about 10% of it because I found out Spotify restricts how much I can save
fuck cash
pain in the ass
niope
I get a student discount though
Even though I am not a student
I'm just using my student email address
It never expired
IDK if I ever registered a NUS card sry
Which one do you work for again? TalkTalk?
rekt
I've started working 09:00 to 17:30 and holy shit does the office get quiet after 17:00
I think 99% of people leave at 17:00
There are more cleaners here than people now
lmao
They all come in when the office staff leave here
lmao
lmao
Well I get to see them every day now!
Because I will work later
I'm worried my manager will think I'm lazy for coming in at 09:00 now
Less traffic, easier to wake up at the same time on weekends
Yeah
HansProleman_:I've set my alarm time to be the same for weekends as weekdays now
wtf so you work 30 mins more a day than me
I can leave at 16:00 on Fridays if I want to only take a 30 min break and get into the office at 08:30
Some people come in at 08:00 and leave at 15:30
Yeah it is, and 7 hour Fridays
I will start working from home in a few weeks hopefully
Then I will play games all day or something
And listen to music!!!!!
No music in my office :(
I hate being 8 hours without my headphones every day
It's so horrible
It's cruel
It's a breach of my human rights
IDK the person sitting next to me is listening to her ipod and talking to herself all day
Yeah I'm worried about my 6 month probation period
I don't want to lose my job some time in the next 6 months......
6 months is such a long time to be so stressed omg
HOME TIME NOW BYE
Annyoung rory
The person next to me talks to herself all day, it's so weird
lmao wtf
I did start replying to her and she just says "I'm talking to myself"
What?
What?
I did for the first week
But I CBA any more
I have 8GB sticks
I keep accidentally holding the spacebar down without realising
I think I would have been fine if I opted for 8GB instead of 16GB
But RAM is so cheap now, that I thought I might as well just spend a little more and get 16GB
8GB is fine in 2016
I have 16 so I can run a couple of different games at the same time
There's not much reason not to now that RAM is so cheap
500GB SSDs are only like £110 now too
I'm going to save up for a year or two and get a Skylake 6700K and GTX980TI
I only have a 4690K and GTX970 right now :(
wtf why would you buy a gtx960 instead of gtx970
You need to upgrade that to a 1080
I have a 500GB SSD and a 200GB HDD
Hansproleman:Yeah but £200 better
Hansproleman:Yeah but can you get >400 FPS in CS:GO?
I've found that I don't really need 3TB HDDs any more now that I use Spotify and Stremio
Yeah I wish Stremio had a better library
Spotify too
So much content is unavailable ffs
lmao I tried Netflix's free trial
Netflix is a fucking joke
I can't find anything on there
The search and metadata doesn't matter at all if the library is a pathetic tiny poo
I think Stremio is probably better
Netflix could probably get a lot of revenue from Stremio users if they just offered a better library
I wouldn't mind paying for Netflix if it was actually good
But no, they just call me a dirty thieving pirate who doesn't want to pay for Bradd Pitt's limosine
Maybe they should focus on improving their service like Steam did instead of whining about piracy all the time
Well there's a lot more artists, albums and songs than there are TV shows and films
And also with films and TV shows, most people just watch western stuff
So they don't need a huge international catalogue like Spotify
lmao my colleague is listening to music on Youtube using her shitty headphone earpiece
It must sound like crap
Our headsets are awful
Well I asked her if it sounds awful and she said no
TLDR?
That comic mocks audiophiles?
How do I save a route on Google maps to use later on my phone instead of the autogenerated one?
The autogenerated one takes me a slightly quicker but less enjoyable route
The difference is like 1% journey length but 100% more enjoyment
Or how do I modify the route on my phone?
I can't wait to go home to do my dailies
Red Orchestra 2?
Is that game quite realistic?
Yeah like in Killing Floor
And Battlefield
It's not balanced for esports though
Have you ever played Day of Defeat? The recoil in that game is INSANE
Half a second of firing the LMG will move your crosshair to the sky
Na, just increase your sensitivity and pull down your mouse really hard
recoil control is just muscle memory
They should make RO:GO
haha yeah I loved the bolt action rifle in Killing Floor
It was probably my favourite gun
You should play CS:GO instead because it is esports
Then get better
I suck at CS:GO too, but that doesn't stop me from playing
The only thing that stops me from playing CS:GO is the new Dota 2 expansion
And my gf
And work
And sleep
Basically anything that takes up a significant amount of my time
Yeah
Hansproleman:Wait, what?
How do I use tree-view file browsing in Windows?
Nice
Vietnam girls are fit
yes
fuck
IT complained about my keyboard's noise
I thought it was okay because the office is so noisy that you can't hear it over the noise sometimes
This keyboard feels so bad to type on
IDK how a non-RGB gamin keyboard is any different from a business keyboard other than the fact it has a windows lock key
Gonna have a fun day out in one of our other offices
What?
Yeah so?
The actuation force feels much higher. I am making less mistakes and not accidentally holding a button down though
This isn't a business keyboard, this is an OEM keyboard
Mechanical keyboards are business keyboards
Gaming keyboards are usually just mechanical keyboards with a windows lock key and RGB lighting
So a non-RGB gaming keyboard is pretty much a business keyboard
Especially my K65 with brushed aluminium
No intrusive logo or patterns or RGB lighting
Just premium metal design
Like a premium business keyboard
Yeah gaming stuff is mostly just styling
Loud keyboards make typing so much more fun!
But my IT department is anti-fun :(
I am in a noisy office too!!!!
Came by way of IT
IDK who really complains about the sound of my typing wtf
Actually I remember someone in IT told me my keyboard is "ridiculous"
lmao but pretty much everyone charges their phones with their PC's USB ports
?
fuck sake I have the old number of a neighbourhood officer
So our tenants are calling me
And I really don't want to talk to them
I'll just give them the neighbourhood officer's new number
They didn't want the call centre's number
Holy shit there's jobs being advertised internally for £60k and £63k
That's over three times what I make
All my money problems would go away if I get the job...
I could finally move away from the parents I hate so much!
IDK haven't checked
I am starting to worry that I will never be as wealthy as my parents who did not go to university
I can't imagine owning my own houses like my parents do
My parents literally own FUCKLOADS of money worth of real estate
They probably own more value of real estate than I will ever own at any point in my life
IDK what BTL is. They bought their houses
brb going to do a poo and Reddit on my phone and get paid for it
lmao
I did it even when paid hourly
I did it even more actually
I think the coffee had laxative effects on me
I did like 7 poos a day with Reddit time
I think once my probation ends I'll talk to my manager and try to bring my mechanical keyboard into work again
But I miss my mechanical keyboard...
I want to type on it
It feels soooooo nice
I don't like it when my colleague next to me is day-snoring and talking to herself, but I don't bitch about it like a bitch
Do you think IT will complain about me using my own mousepad?
lmao
CBA TO WORK ANY MORE GOING HOME NOW BYE
fuck im depressed
CBA to go see my gf
It's so far away
I would move in with her if she'd just agree to pay half the rent, but she never will
part time at co-op
Iota-work:The one in town
Near the bus stop
IDK
The person who works next to me keeps complaining that I can't hear her over my SE215s lmao
Shure SE215s OP
The noise isolation is really really good, I really recommend these for budget IEMs
I really like them
Well, if you consider £60-£80 to be budget
I guess they're more lower-midrange
I hate how my ear wax gets stuck on my IEM tips ewwww
If I had £1bn I could hire a team to invest my money for me and I would become perpetually richer without doing anything myself lmao
What?
How old do you think you'll be when you retire?
Well you kinda do because of compound interest
Since I want to retire at 55, 17% of my salary is currently going into my pension fund
But 10% of that is paid by the employer, so it's just a 7% reduction of my salary
But it's not taxed
But £1 saved today will add a lot more to my retirement fund than £1 saved in 20 years from now
To my pension fund
Because of compound interest 'n' shit
Wouldn't it go flat by the time you drink it
?
It would probably last me 2 nights, at least
Yeah
35 pints is nothing
20L is only enough for 4 people at the most
You need three of those for a party of 10
wtf?
how am I being silly omg
Do you even know basic division?
Assuming each person drinks 8 pints, then 35 pints is not enough for more than 4
wtf why are you even drinking beer at a business dinner
My workplace has a strict no alcohol policy
How the fuck is beer going to be good for your productivity?
omg you guys are so fucking stupid
nice copypasta
wtf no
president
What's the next step up from president of the united states? CEO of Walmart or something?
Yeah but Walmart is a bigger company
Google isn't even in the top 50
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue
holy shit
$200m wtf
How the fuck can you even spend all that
wtffffffff
Why do they need so much money omg
They are like the BP of Asia?
I just want a job that pays well enough to buy a house without taking out a massive fucking mortgage
rory:LMAO
lmao
I wish I was my aunt. She never worked a day in her life but inherited a £200k+ house
If you never buy a house, and you get ill and cannot work, you could become homeless in the future
Retire early sounds nice
Not if you don't have a mortgage
Download Dota 2
brb gym
I am back
lmao
omg have you seen the new Stremio update?
New plugins!
YIFY and Popcorn Time and Streamfeed
Might be YTS
YTS=YIFY Torrent Site or something
I wonder what his framerate is in CS:GO
For more framerate?
High framerate gaming is becoming more popular
lmao who cares about single-thread performance nowadays?
Well I guess if you can get 999FPS in CS:GO with one core then that is the absolute ideal
He probably had to disable HT too. I remember I had to disable HT to get the highest OC on my i3 530
Yes, but a single core has less latency if the framerate is the samer
So a single core at 999FPS is best
Liquid nitrogen cooling doesn't seem practical though
There have been latency benchmarks done with multicore and single-core processing
If the framerate is locked at a specific value, then you will have less input lag in CS:GO
The reason why most people use multicore is because they cannot reach 999
999 is best for CS:GO because anything over 999 causes the engine to fuck up and can increase input lag
Nobody can play at 999 though because CPUs aren't fast enough yet
Most people play at 300-400
wtf why is only one person able to edit an Excel file at a time
If they could do liquid nitrogen cooling for <£200 and without maintenance, then it would be marketable
But I guess it is too expensive and requires too much maintenance and possibly too dangerous
I think CPU cooling could do with a revolution
omg I went to do a poo and when I got back to my desk my colleague said I had been gone a long time
I like to go use the toilet in the other corner of the office because it is less busy which is nice when I want to poo and Reddit
It's so offputting when there are other people there
omg Overwatch is back in beta
I want that game so hard
It's probably the only new release in 2016 that I'm excited about
congrats
You should have got Shure SE215 though
They come with lots of tips
http://www.head-fi.org/a/headphone-buying-guide
yours aren't even on the guide!!!!
wow that sucks
My Shure SE215s are better than your crappy Sennheisers
How did you get those vouchers?
lmao
Most special person?
ffs why can't two people edit an Excel file at the same time
so fucking annoying wtf
I think Windoze 7 PCs with a shared networked drive and a recent version of Microsoft Excel
.Ita rory
Who do you want to become president, Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders?
lmao
I saw him in that video
WIDGET AREA 1
Click here to assign a widget to this area.
His website template isn't even complete
I don't know why Hilary Clinton thinks she has a chance. Americans would NEVER vote for a woman; they hate woman so much that they voted for a mixed-race president to keep a woman from becoming president
Also, she seems really sleazy
Iota-work:what?
lmao my mother celebrates pancake day but not the new year wtf
wtf
Wanna play Overwatch with me?
lmao my colleague says I need to turn my music volume down so I can hear her, but I'm not even listening to music!
I just have my IEMs in
Wanna make an Overwatch team with me?
Me too because I have no friends :(
wtf m9?
Weird that you play LoL then
omg I want to do a poo but I am worried my colleague will tell me I was gone a long time again
wtf
your on IRC and Reddit at work
lmao
TIL you can take bigger dumps when not on probation
I do three big poos a day
It looks like Overwatch is going to use a fairer Dota/CS-esque business model instead of the greedy p2w model that Riot uses
The initial pricetag is a bit steep though
It would be better if they made it free
I can't take it any more, I really need to do a poo!!!!!!!!!1
Gameplay-affecting things
Dota only sells cosmetics
Is it just me, or does Spotify's random play feature always play the same 50 songs in a playlist?
Is what new?
Overwatch's business model?
Yes, the business model was just announced
If that's what you're referring to?
Heroes, in-game stats and abilities, etc
Lots of gameplay-affecting stuff a new player doesn't have
When will all heroes be free?
Aren't runes, masteries, summoner spells, etc all in-game stats and abilities?
League of Legends reminds me of Scientology, it's such a fucking cult omg
They always talk about ideology and use such a greedy business model whilst brainwashing their customers into defending it
Riot Game is such a shady company
And their parent company Tencent
Really shady
You remind me of Tom Cruise defending his cult. He doesn't think he's wrong, everyone else is!
For your phone?
Why not just listen to your discover weekly on your phone thne
And why do you have two phones?!?!??!?!??!?
Why not just put the work sim into your personal phone?
Why not just put the work sim into your personal phone?
lmao
I have the same problem
Luckily it's just two of us using it and we sit next to each other
So we take it in turns
This channel moves too fast for me to keep up
What's that?
wtf how would I know the characters?
wtf is a brainless moe?
You mean m0e?
m0e is a brainless twitch streamer
stfu you weeb
I have
LMAO
With your gf?
You mean your anime pillow?
I am trying to decide whether to drive or get the train to Brighton
The train fucks up a lot
lmao sure
My gf does, and her opinion matters more than yours because she's Korean
wtf you are?
nice thanks
IDK man I CBA to go visit my gf
Why?
Moving where?
I can fit my desktop PC in a rucksack
I wish I could use my desktop PC for work instead of this slow laptop
Why is our spreadsheet collaboration functionality so non-existant omfg
I keep getting asked to close the file so that someone else can edit it wtf
lmao yeah
I want to know the make and model omfg
I usually just do a reverse image search on it to try and find it
if they're not stock, then try to crop out any irrelevant stuff to just include the product, then do the reverse image search and hope for the best
Or contact the advertiser
lmao
Get a Red Bull + meaty sandwich and meaty snack
For like £3
That's a lot of money
How long do you think it'll take me to save up for one of those?
Even China can only afford one of them
And China is rich as fuck
wow Thailand has an aircraft carrier
That's surprising
Thailand has just as many aircraft carriers as China
Have they recreated the failed anti-sink systems?
And the same propulsion system?
Creating a replica is pretty retarded IMO
There's reasons why similar ships are not made today
It's a pretty shitty replica then
Have they made divisions for upper and lower class people too?
lmao
So we would get the lower class rooms ^^
Tony Blair and George Bush would get upper class
All scrubs get rekt by Global Elite
lmao
I love how you eat healthy
Maybe it wouldn't be pointless if you actually went to the gym
lmao sure you do
That's not really often enough
Try doing three weightlifting sessions and two cardio sessions
I don't think it's good to do both
10 mins isn't really enough for a proper cardio workout
You need to do 30 mins
Sure you can, I haven't raised my heartbeat beyond 150 for about 10 years, but I can still manage it
At least try to work up to it
You're a lot lighter than me too
So you should be able to manage it m9
The important thing is that you keep your heartbeat in the cardio training zone for as long as possible
Maybe try a different exercise
Try the crosstrainer if your legs are getting too tired, and workout using your arms more
Yeah same
I like the bike so I can use my phone more
But I prefer the crosstrainer overall
I wish I could watch youtube videos on the crosstrainer....
I might get a helmet-arm-type-thingy
To mount the phone in fornt of me
Hmmmm do you think Google Cardboard would work on the crosstrainer?
Basically I just want to mount a display in front of my face that isn't the shitty MTV TVs
I want to watch pro dota whilst doing a cardio workout
wtf why do most of our business websites only work with Internet Explorer
What a fucking joke
lmao
no m9 I go in my lunch hour
When I get bored doing office things
lmao
Did you use the shower after you cycled?
yes I fucking do omfg
lmao you are the stinky one then
It's not proper cardio then
Probably just fat burning at the most
You need to raise your heartbeat above 150!!!!
lmao why not?
is there any way to continue getting my salary without actually working?
Wouldn't that just as like get me assassinated?
They might find it cheaper to hire a hitman for less than they pay my salary
You can probably find a hitman for less than £19k?
I am 420sam
lmao
I'd rather not die from a fucking heart attack just because I CBA to do cardio
HansProleman:lmao
lmao
Why?
I have a playlist for Korean girls and a playlist for Chinese girls
wtf 130lbs is 59kg
That's fuck all wtf
tiny puny HansProleman
lmao
My gym is downstairs from the building I'm in
Could walk over there in like 20 seconds right now
Could probably run there within like 6-8 seconds
Just gotta get past the fucking autolocking door and the staircase
If there was a hole in the floor, I could get there within 1 second
wow that's more than I earn in a year
IDK why you thought that
Maybe you're thinking of someone else
lmao
why are you so poor?
How much pension do you earn?
My pension is 17% of my salary ^^
hahahahaha I just won the Data Protection quiz in front of the CEO and most people in my office
No prize :(
I wish I had £500 though, since I can't afford rent this month
Fucking shitty government won't give me my benefits
unemployment benefits!!!!
I didn't get any
So have to go 3 months with being paid anything
And now I'm struggling to pay rent
My mum refuses to lend me anything
Even though I've lent her money lots of times
I'll have to accept my grandparents' bridging loan which makes me feel bad taking money from them
Yeah but it's UC now
stricter requirements
months
been out of work
AmerieHartree:nobody
I got paid just within the first UC period, which made me ineligible for benefits
So I had to wait another month
So no pay for January
And then I found a job at the end of January
So a month out of work without benefits
Then a month of waiting to get paid
My final pay from my last role
I finished work on the 24th and the UC period is 25-25th
But I didn't get paid for my final week until January
Because of Christmas payment delays
So that made me ineligible for unemployment benefit
Oh I didn't realise that if I delayed my application by a week I would have got more benefits
That seems like a really shitty design
I have to time my application to get the most benefits
Instead of it being done automatically
Did they change benefits from weekly to monthly periods just to make more people ineligible?
To not pay people on the months they start and stop work?
Instead of just the weeks?
I was unemployed for over a month, but because I received my final paycheck at the start of January and my next paycheck at the end of February, I am in effect going two months without pay without any social security
My mum increased my rent too
I asked her if I can borrow some money, but she said no
So I can't afford my rent now
I told her she can fuck off if she wants to ask to borrow money from me again
My grandparents offered me a "bridging loan"
Because I applied for UC near the end of the month
not calandar months omg
Yeah
Wouldn't have made a difference though
Paid my final paycheck on 4th January, getting paid on 26th of February
No
Max 1 month UC
Will get it on the 25th/26th I guess
I will get my UC payment and first month's salary in one go
Probably pay a shitload of tax on it
Because of double payment
I paid a shitload of tax on my last paycheck too
I rarely get paid, and when I do I pay a shitload of tax on it
PAYE sucks because I'm poor and I get taxed way more than I should
Because it's calculated each week rather than annually
So I have to phone up the fucking HMRC and Student Loan company and ask for my money back
Because they took so much of it and I can't afford to pay rent now
25th of December
yes that's right
Because I finished working on the 24th of December but didn't get paid until the 4th of January
So 2 months out of work, and 2 months without any income
And a rent increase
My gf wants me to go visit her tonight
And spend lots of money on her
Even though I have to borrow money from my grandparents for the next two weeks
She tells me I need to pay for her food and entertainment and condoms and things
I asked her to pay and she said no
But she is Korean...
ffs I need to get my car fixed, but I work full time and they don't do work on Saturdays
IDK what to do
Can't afford taxi
Rural taxis are expensive
My manager says if I take the car there I can make up the hours on another day
yeah but I am on probation so I'm scared of losing my job
But my mum always tells me I won't pass my probation unless I pick up my boot straps
lmao
Well there's always gonna be some sort of gap
Cars don't connect to each other when driving
But it might be a small gap
Can someone please explain to me what space is?
Should I indicate right along the whole slip road?
Or just before I turn?
What actually is space?
Yeah I guess so
So just once I have the speed and position for merging then I guess
Thanks!
I've never done it before, but I will need to on the 23rd
I hate roundabouts with multiple lanes
WTF LANE AM I SUPPOSED TO GET INTO
Stupid fucking Google Maps won't tell me
Yeah but what if I don't know whether I want to get on the A420 or the A322?
I don't know where the fuck I'm going half the time
lmao
Well I have Google Maps, I just wish it'd tell me which fucking lane to get in
Cashback how?
referral link for what?
omg the person next to me always makes me feel so guilty for going to the toilet. When I return to my desk she always asks me "WHERE HAVE OYU BEEN?!?!??!"
IDK hard to follow chat
It moves so fast
lmao why do you think I would do something dodgy and get us banned?!??!
omg Microsoft Exchange is down and I can't send emails!!!!!!!!!!1
because my mechanical keyboard is banned at work
Also because I suck at typing
Taking my car to the dealership to get repaired on Thursday
I really hope they fix it and don't charge me for it
Gonna be so upset if I'm either charged it it's not fixed
I have a 12 month warranty and I think the problem might have been present since I bought the car, since it is a water leak and I bought the car in the summer
No I am not confrontational, just factual
But I think they really should fix it for me for free
And since I have financial problems, I will be so unhappy if they don't
I might ask my grandparents to pay for it
Like they paid for my new car battery
I'm going to see money advice people on Thursday
Try and figure out wtf I'm gonna do with my money
I spend some of it on rent, some on PC upgrades, and some on my gf, but IDK what to do with the restr
2% without tax is still less than 3% with rax
I bought a really nice gaming chair for only £60
http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ENZ1T4Y?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00
Yeah but it's a fucking nice chair
Best chair you're gonna get for under £90
Does it look good to you?
wtf why not?
It has orange stripes"!
what the actual fuck
you want to spend 20X as much
And it's not even a gaming chair
you know you have too much money and no life when you want to spend £900 on a fucking office chair
jinjja
lmfao are you calling me an idiot?
make sure you get good back support, it's important!!!!!!1
My last chair fucked up my back because my mum bought me a cheap one
lmao
Do you ever exercise your back?
LMAO
'massage'
It's just a way to avoid getting arrested for prostitution
All massagers are prostitutes
I didn't see her
lmao sure you did
I don't drink because I don't want cancer
Being mad you like fat chicks is understandable
Is it true?
How much do you weigh?
175lbs is 80kg
wtf
you're too skinny and she's too fat
freaky
If she sat on you, you would helplessly crushed
130 is
175 too fat
130 too skinny
You should be 65-75kg
WHAT THE FUCK
You are so creepy srsly
What you are saying is not natural
It's devious
You are a sexual deviant
Sure if that's how you want to justify it
Not all my life obviously wtf
There's such a thing called the age of consent, you perv
This is too NSFW for me
Bye
srsly? You sound like you're living in the 60s
There's nothing wrong with having relationships with someone of another race omfg
We're not living in Aparthied any more
How much did she weigh?
To be fair, everyone has strong preference for asian
ewww
so if you meet a kpop girl you wouldn't desire her?!?!?
lmao sure
annyoung rory
anyoung
omg I hate cleaning suppliers
Why can't they make up their fucking minds and send me proper financial info
wtf our home-working solution is a remote desktop and not a VPN?!?!?
Why the fuck is a remote desktop easier than a VPN?
I don't see why I would need a remote desktop for Microsoft Office when I have it installed on my laptop
And they need to buy software licenses twice because of remote desktop LMAO
wtf?
your an egocentrist
RDP sucks
I can't use it on 3G
It's laggy
It uses a lot of bandwidth
It requires two software licenses for everything
We can't use the network shared drives
I might buy the new Street Fighter
lmao
I think I have £120 left over now
I saved a shitload of money by taking out a £250 overdraft and cancelling my valentines trip
Although I need to buy a new tank of fuel for about £40 with that £120
So I have £80 left over
For video games and energy drinks
I can easily get some money from my grandparents too
Probably my father if I ask him nicely
And if I really have to, I can withdraw from my TSB monthly saver
But I would prefer now to, because then I can't redeposit it
not to*
I need to find some higher-interest accounts
5% isn't really enough for me to save up for a mortgage deposit
wtf?
IDK how old are you? I'm 24
wow your old
wtf Spotify is Netflix now?
Well 24 kinda counts as early 20s I guess
It's still less than half way through my 20s
24th
omg
They say they will have to replace all my seals, but that it is not covered under the warranty
And they also said I had a leaking water pipe that is covered by the warranty
Yes
?
14.04 wtf
That's old
2 months until 16.04 omg
I think I'll switch from W10 to Ubuntu 16.04
NEW CSGO OPERATION
STUPID CAR COSTS
Thank you for your sympathy
2 months until 16.04!
LTS
Nice!
How old is she? Is she single?
I use LTS on desktops
You're more of a Fedora guy?
I'm confused
You don't use Linux at all?
I strongly disagree that Windoze is easier and looks nicer than Ubuntu
STRONGLY disagree
Windows just has way better proprietary application support
It's strength is more the result of its monopoly than any actual merit of its own
Definitely
Linux in general is a lot safer
....
Well yeah I guess
But there's so many others
Me too
Until 16.04 and Overwatch
Do you play games?
I think those games run on Linux now, but you should check
Linux gaming is rapidly chasing up to Linux atm thanks to Valve
Valve are really pushing it hard
Gaming is the main thing holding me back atm
But almost all my games are now ported, I'm just waiting for Overwatch really
New Blizzard FPS game
Looks really fun
rory and I are going to play it together when it comes out
No
did you hear about how the US government has ordered Apple to unlock someone's encrypted iphone?
How are Apple going to find that any easier than the FBI? I would have thought the FBI/NSA would be the encryption-cracking experts
HansProleman:Yeah tha'ts what I'm thinking
I don't see how it's Apple's job
They are not cracking experts
They are only ordering them because they built the phone wtf
They didn't design encryption
Well Apple said they were also ordered to add a backdoor into their OS, which they have refused to do
Adding a backdoor sounds like an incredibly stupid thing to do
omg
The dealership want £453 to fix my car's seals
I bought my car from them last summer and got a 12 month warranty
And now they want £453 to fix my car
It sucks having savings, it just all goes to rent and fixing my car
Where else is it supposed to come from? My non-existant income?
I work 1 month in arrears
Yeah and my salary will pay my overdraft and the money I borrowed from my grandparents to pay my rent
your not fucking funny m9
I got 5 viewings arranged last night
IDK yet. I'm going to some viewings at least
My mum is telling me that I will struggle to pay for food and wash/iron my clothes and never be allowed back home if I move out
Does this look good to you? https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/wiltshire/wedhampton/2804619
Why?
I already get told not to do things
Not to bring girls round, not to do my own cooking, etc
The single room is only £390
I pay my mum £350 atm, but that includes food, ironing, laundry, sometimes even clothes and shampoo
I don't care if the bed is a single, but I need a big desk for PC gaming
If the desk is too small, it will be a deal-breaker
I don't care about bed size really, although a bigger bed is nice for when I have girls round
god you creep me out
"even w thin women" do you realise how creepy that sounds?
wtf is DPS?
damage per second?
wtf is deposit protection scheme
don't be creepy pls
LMFAO http://cloud9.gg/news/freakazoid-apology
Additionally, Ryan will be attending an anti-bullying seminar in Los Angeles, CA hosted by PACER
Its literally going to be him and a bunch of 13 year olds.
?
lmao wtf
half lit wtf
I want to buy a house, but I don't want to wait until I'm in my 30s before moving out of my parents' house
It's an auction
It's going to sell for a lot more than £10,000
Even when it crashes, it won't be cheaper than it is now
Investor properties
People have money to invest
As the population increases and the supply of land remains constant, the value of property is likely to maintain an upwards trend
Yeah I'm really worried about interest rates
I bet they'll stay low whilst I'm saving, then increase when I want to buy lmao
Why?
I would move to Germany, but I can't speak German
Ich nicht sprechen sie Deutsch!!!!!
I'd rather move to Korea or China
Good thing Thailand, China and Korea aren't in SEA then
Actually Thailand is
But the other two aren't
well yes
Central Asia is India and arab countries
wtf
DO THEY LOOK EAST ASIAN?!?!?!?
fucking racist
wtf is stromfront
Is that the new blizzard moba?
oh not what I was thinking of then
So you're a creepy racist
And racist.
Being a white supremecist makes you a racist, dumbass
Racist people ALWAYS deny being racist
Thank you for proving it
wtf does "We are country people" in the context of "interests" mean?
Oh god doesn't look good http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=country+people
Maybe I shouldn't move into the manor
lmao
Sounds boring as fuck
Wat about videogames?!?!?
lmao one of the viewings I'm going to is surrounded by dozens of our social houses
Well I live in the country and I play videogames, so I prove you wrong
lmao I know what dogging is
There's lots of dogging going on where I live
Well I live in the country, so I guess so?
wtf
Dogging is wrong
You're a creepy fuck srsly
You should be put on the sex offenders register
Warm can be good
Warm brie and chicken sandwich <3
Warm bacon sandwich <3
I wish I had more money
So I wouldn't have to worry about rent and fuel and things so much
And I could upgrade my PC
If I sell my car I lose my job
£350 out to mum
Varies depending on how many weeks there are in the month
Sometimes it's only £320
Sometimes it's £400
Usually it's £320
  it run on Linux?
ffs out of stock https://www.g2a.com/you-need-a-budget-4-steam-cd-key-global.html?___store=great_britain
About £30
Actually
Probably about £5
£50
Actually
About £40 I think
Yeah I think £40 is about right
420
No I mean a month
I spend £40-£50 a month on drugs
congrats
Pension is deducted before I get salary
I get £1,230 a month after deductions
I'm on £19k
My employer contributes 10% of my salary
$100 gas for a whole month WHAT THE FUCK http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/227320/ss_54a4d1c267f1e3824759ca02da9e69b36474440d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447357139
What is your salary?
Who is your employerr?
Nice, I think I'll be stuck on 19k for at least 5 years
yes
A worthless one like media studies
swansea
2:2
Not really
I didn't choose engineering or computer science
I still use a lot of my degree just to make simple decisions
I think I overanalyse things
There's no need to run an insignificant decision through 5 economic models
But got to maximise utility, manage risk, maximise profit, etc!
Yeah gotta chart those budget constraints and indifference curves too
Economics teaches you a shitload of models just to make a decision whether to buy a bigmac or a burrito
I'm talking about consumer choice, not macroeconomics
But yeah, there's some BS there and a lot of it contradicts other theory
Can I connect YNAB to my bank accounts?
I don't know how much I spend on food
No fucking idea
I just buy shit when I need it
wtf is this BS "Bank import currently only supports US and Canadian banks, but file based import is coming soon."
But that's more work for me
I don't want to manually export all my bank accounts all the time
I have videogames to playt
Budgeting is easy, I just pay my mum rent, save the rest, then buy what I need/want
Logging into my bank accounts is a fucking pain though
With mobile authenticators and choosing 3 digits of my passcode and shit like that
Why can't I just use a password omg
yeah
Especially when I'm banking with 4 different banks
Stupid monthly savers won't let me deposit everything in one account
So I need 3-4 banks
lmao I'm never going to have £75k in savings
I don't need a budget, I just need more money
And more interest
I want £500k savings and 15% interest
I can pay it, I just don't want to reduce my savings
By four hundred and fucking fifty fucking pounds
I will have a problem if I need to withdraw from my Help to Buy ISA or First Direct Monthly Saver, but I'm safe as long as I don't need to spend more than £1000 within the next 7 days
My TSB 5% monthly saver has unlimited withdrawals I think?
But if I withdraw from my FD monthly saver, then they close my account...
And I don't want to withdraw from my help to buy isa either, because I want a £3000 grant in 4 years
So I don't touch those two accounts no matter what
My emergency funds are my TSB monthly saver and TSB current account
Which I have £1,000 in
And FD is emergency too I guess
And even help to buy isa if it's going to save my life
It will be even more in 7 days
And a lot more once I get all my fucking overpaid tax and student loan back
In like a year lmao
Fuck PAYE
HansProleman:wtf
But you earn more than me
And have been working longer
What the fuck do you spend all your money on
Iota:wtf why
Go cash it in now!!!!!!
wtf
Ask HMRC for another cheque
How much would food and ironing and laundry cost me a week?
wtf upfront
£2 wtf
How does that work
£50 for food?
What about laundry?
So £50 a week more than living with my parents?
Damn, that's a lot....
That's £217 more a month
350+217=567
That's £217 less I can save a month omg
£2607.142857142857 less a year
£10428.57142857143 less for my mortgage deposit in 4 years
fuck
I don't think I can afford to move out
omfg
I need that £10,000
I'm saving over £10,000 by staying with my parents
That's fucking crazy when I think of it like that
That will be a significant portion of my mortgage deposit
fuck sake
The next 4.5 years are going to suck no matter what I do
Do you live with your parents?
Sharing the rent between two people doesn't sound too bad
It would cost me a lot more because I need to pay for everything myself
How much do you budget for food and laundry and ironing?
Okay so laundry and ironing is insignificant
It's food that's the big deal
I don't like a lot of the food my mum cooks me, and sometimes she gets drunk and forgets it and burns it anyway
And I don't like how I can't queue for a game of dota because I have no fucking idea when the food will be ready
Sometimes I can't queue for like 4 hours
because I have no fucking idea
I'm just hanging around reading shitty reddit posts
wtf you're really old?
you enjoy paying more than twice as much rent?
do that and lose your job/health dumbass
£1,000 a month wtf that's almost all my salary
I need to get richer because by the time I'm 50 there probably won't be any social security left to claim
Yeah me too...
I kinda doubt I'm going to last another 10 years
FUCK SAKE IT'S CARDIO TODAY BUT I FORGOT MY FUCKING IEMS
MY DAY IS FUCKING RUINED
OMFG
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
Iota rory AmerieHartree What do you think of this place? I'm going to view it this evening https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/wiltshire/wedhampton/2804619
So I will just take my dumps in the nice one
I never use the bathroom other than the toilet anyway
I don't shower at home
wat the fuck m9?
shave at work obviously
wat?
At work
I think I need to find a gf who will share the rent and not complain about all the videogames I play
Haven't had much time to play it yet. I played a new map last night, never played it before, made sure to flame everyone all game, they tried to kick me, but I still won the game at the top of the scoreboard
I don't like boys
I know I am not attracted to them
No, I look at boys all the time
wtf
You don't look at boys too?
wtf
Sounds like you're not open minded.
I read about sexuality on wikipedia and I found that I am either heterosexual or asexual
wtf you had a bf before?
I've just added Iota to my list of creeps
fuck you trolls, I'm going to the gym
shit I forgot my IEMs and my towl
I don't understand my mother. If she hates living with me so much, why is she trying to scare me from leaving?
fuck sake I think I just overdosed on caffeine
lmao I went to look at a shitty house amongst our social houses, then a massive mansion right after
The contrast was amazing
And it's only £40 more!
I could go live in a massive fucking 1000 year old mansion right now if I wanted to
lmao why?
I turned it down anyway, because rural internet sucks ass
And I can't watch films on Stremio!
I fucking love Stremio now
It's so good
I am getitng paid in a week
nice
I'm pretty satisfied with my home connection; it's fast enough to stream HD video
wow that's fast
That's twice as fast as mine
Actually, I can't remember how fast mine is exactly
I don't really need the speed, I don't download many big games
It would be nice if 4k video streams would take off
I have doubts I'm going to have a >1080p monitor within 5 years at this rate :(
high refresh rate monitors rarely have high resolution
I bought a new monitor last year, and it was still only 1080p
>1080p is too expensive
wtf is a pro rts monitor
I got a 144hz gaming monitor
wtf you think you need to be a pro to benefit from 144hz?
It's pretty good, they added a co-op story mode
And the new Nuke looks really pretty
The game running on max graphics on Nuke looks pretty good
Valve is updating the maps to try and make the game look more modern
me too
Yeah probably
I don't play much
It's hard to stay at the top ranks unless you play every day
Sure you can
I am good at every game I play
same
You can get help from another home ownership scheme called â€˜Older Peopleâ€™s Shared Ownershipâ€™ if youâ€™re aged 55 or over.
It works in the same way as the general shared ownership scheme, but you can only buy up to 75% of your home. Once you own 75% you wonâ€™t have to pay rent on the remaining share.
wtf
So you can pretty much live in a house for free if you buy 75% of it
Macros can execute commands outside of the file/program sandbox?
Maybe we should just use Linux instead?
That sounds insecure as fuck
wtf are macros anyway
lmao that's so stupid
why is that in a spreadsheet file
wtf
lmao sure
Nobody even knows hwat they do
I thought Excel had really amazing functionality built into it?
Are you saying it's not enough?
I've never had problems doing any calculations inside Excel
Or Gnumeric
Or Libre Calc
Those aren't built-in functions?
Can I pull data from esportsearnings.com and make some calculations using macros?
No, I mean pull the data using macros and make calculations in Excel
Hmmm I'll have a look now
Oh wow that's interesting
I can use this to measure the growth of the scene eac hyear
How do I do this in Libreoffice Calc?
lmao
Maybe I'll just download Windows Office then
Does it run on Ubuntu?
Looks like it runs okay https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=17336
Gonna go for my pre-workout poo now
Motivational posters are so stupid
wtf why do you want Riot API data?
FUCK SAKE SOMEONE STOLE MY MILK FROM THE FRIDGE
OH MY FUCKING GOD
MY DAY IS FUCKING RUINED
fuck you
An email got sent around the office last week telling us we can only use the business's milk for tea and coffee. Then this week the business uses my milk!!!!!!
Employees act on behalf of the business
fuck no
I bought the milk for me
It's MY milk
And it was stolen
Now I have to label all my shit in the fridge
I don't cut people off because I practice safe driving
I am operating an extremely heavy machine at extremely high speeds, I can't afford to make unsafe manoeuvres!!!!!!!!!!1
ffs I am getting really bad chest pain and I can't get an appointment before the 15th. I'm probably going to be dead by then. It's a fucking joke
I haven't used the NHS for over 10 years, and now I actually need it they're making me wait almost a month before seeing me wtf
nice troll
you know you can get prosecuted for wasting their time, right?
Thanks for encouraging me to break the law, dickhead
Just because I am a victim of crime doesn't mean I should become a criminal too
"sudden severe chest pain"
It's not sudden
it's not severe
It's just a dull pain in the centre of my chest and stretching slightly over my left peck

 IDK haven't listened to it yet
 Only seen the Reddit post
What?
 When?
 What?
Listening to what?
 Yeah was listening to some Monstercat because I was doing cardio
League of Legends fan music wtf
So?
 wtf are you talking abot
about*
 Do you think esports should be suits or memes? 2GD just got fired from Shanghai for too many memes!
 Yeah
Well that's not really a detailed description, is it?
 lmao I thought you weren't intereted in Dota?
 Why are you reading /r/dota threads?
 lmao at one point the top 5 posts of /r/all were about 2GD
 it's probably the biggest esports drama ever
 you should watch the 2GD Shanghai highlights video, it's fucking hilarious
 The production had nothing to do with 2GD
 The production was fired and replaced, but it wasn't 2GD's fault at all
He made a lot of very funny jokes
 He tried really hard to keep the stream entertaining because the production team was doing such a shit job
And he got fired for too many dank memes
 It's really unfair
He was a great host
 If it wasn't for him, day 1 wouldn't have been worth watching at all, since the production team was so shit
 I share the same opinion as millions of others
2GD wanted to make the stream fun, but Gaben wanted to make it professional
But Gaben had the final say
You really think whining about it is going to solve anything?
 I will hit Valve where it hurts
 Instead of spending £30 on the compendium, I will only spend £15
That'll show Gaben
 wtf?
Why would #bible be advertising in #anxiety?
How are they are all related?
Famous esports host and former esports athelete
 What do you think looks best, the Samsung S7 or the LG G5?
 I'm leaning towards the Samsung S7, but the LG G5 removable battery and expansion slot is pretty cool
 They both look like great phones
 How much?
 "massively"?
How much has the battery increased by?
2550mah to 3000mah?
Is that a lot?
Increased by about 20%?
But I heard the screen is always-on now which will drain the battery faster
 I am listening to Chinese music
what the fuck my company is storing our customers' passwords in plaintext
 What headphones do you think are best to use in the office? I might start bringing in my Beyer DT770s instead of my Shure SE215s
Since I won't be moving around or building up a sweat, circumaural headphones could be better than IEMs
And probably less isolation but without any leakage
 I find my DT770s more comfortable too
Yeah I think I'll start bringing in my DT770s tomorrow
LMAO BBC DANK MEME http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35667990
"With 9-11 year-olds, we are seeing a lot of people get excited about it at that level," said Mr Upton.
rory:
Got SE215s, DT770s and K702s
 So open, closed and IEM :)
 lmao nice
Do you think listening to music in another language makes me more intelligent?
 kinda like how babies listening to mozart makes the more intelligent?
 so listening to kpop makes me more intelligent?
Annyoung rory
Happy Samiljeol!
What if I lose it?
 Will they replace it?
 What if it gets burnt in a fire?
 What if it gets stolen?
What if I go to them with two halves of a bag, do I get 2 new bags?
I'd rather rescue my gaming PC
Or my gf
Do bags for life transfer between supermarkets?
If they don't, I don't see how they're bags for life
What if you become disabled and unable to carry the bag, will they supply you with a special disability bag for the rest of your life?
Or are they actually "bags for life or until you become disabled"?
What if you buy it for your dog which has a lower life expectancy, is it cheaper?
I want my benefits omg
I want my fucking benefits omg
Fucking government hasn't given me any social security for my period of unemployment
 Yeah but I was told I would get something for when I was unemployed
 I was living on my savings for two months
Because the government refused to help me
wtf
You serious?
That's fucking retarded
I phoned up Universal Credit and they told me I would get paid
So they lied
lmao that can't be right
 Why would they deny benefits to people who have earnt a bit of money?
That disincentives claimants from finding work
 I spent it on rent and a car to get a job
It's 100% of my income sometimes
 Thanks
YES GOT MY BENEFITS
 k65
What is "dh"?
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Right
k
K65 is a good keyboard
I lik eit
Been playing Street Fighter on it
 I have a spare Paladins key, wanna play with me?
 It's like Overwatch, but not as good
Does anyone know how to count the amount of cells in a column which have dates before today's date?
Annyoung rory
 But I don't know how to cook
 instructions unclear, dick stuck in butter
 nice
 My gym is in my office
 So I go in my lunch hour
 wtf you got up at 07:00? I get up at 08:20
 lmao
 I have the same complaint m9
 Yeah, read some guides and did some trial and error
 Added lots of formulas to the conditional formatting to make the spreadsheet much easier for us to use
 IDK I didn't see what you said
 I used some COUNTIFs and TODAY() and other commands
 Before I started working here, they were changing the highlighting of >TODAY() by themselves....
 So I created a rule to do it automatically
Because fuck manual
 They were manually highlighting cells because there was no formula to do it for them
 They were highlighted them green for future dates, and red for passed dates
 And lots of them weren't red which should have been
 lmao
 Yeah, I just saved the company a shitload of man hours
Or more accurately, I saved them womanhours
Depends what you define as basic
Everyone knows basic Excel
Lots of people don't know intermediate
wtf?
I use Libreoffice Calc normally, so I don't know how to use Excel very well
What meme?
But men and women do different jobs?
That's an easy fact to prove
 I would tell you how much I hate feminists and SJWs, but I don't feel like losing my job today
 No idea, better not risk it
 There could always be some asshole looking over my shoulder anyway
 Or there could be someone watching my PC remotely
I really should start using more encryption
 lmao why?
 Both
 Mostly the paranoia
 lmao
 Yeah same
 What IRC chans are you on?
 I only go on SFW ones
 I KNOW OMFG
I almost lost an entire playlist
A public playlist I was subscribed to went from >1000 songs to 255 yesterday
IDK looks like the playlist author just decided to slim it down a shitload for no reason
I hate it when my own created playlist randomly shrinks
 Yeah it's okay though, plenty more large EDM playlists
 yeah
 But I usually hide songs I cannot play
No point seeing tem
I hate how much kpop is not available in the UK
Spotify should offer a discounted subscription fee to kpop fans in the UK
Smaller subscription fee for smaller library
THEY NEED TO UP THE OFFLINE DOWNLOAD LIMIT FROM 3,333 TO 10K OR MORE OMFG
 no it's not
 if you go to another country then you get more songs
 3,333 is low
3,333 is like 1/10th of my MP3 player's storage
 Got 500MB data
 scam?
 How is having offline songs a scam?
wtf
 You have to login at least once every 30 dyas
 It's fine, I never go more than 30 days without a connection
 I think Steam works the same way
 LMAO
Paying for more data just because you can't save your collection locally is retarded
It'll eat more battery too
 And streaming music isn't good for your connection when gaming either...
 lmao...
 So I hsould just download 3,333 songs every time I go for a journey?
 Instead of having them ready all the time?
Spotify is supposed to be more convenient than piracy, not less
Streaming services nowadays have offline downloading as a standard feature
 Look at the competition
Google allows you to download like 50k songs
.np
 wtf why?
I can claim drugs on my expenses form?!?!??!?!?

What's with all the SJWs playing video games all of a sudden?
 What?
 lmao why?
LMAO
ROTFLMFAO
 lmao same
WHY ARE OFFICE PCS ALWAYS SO SLOW OMG
Companies should overclock more
If they had a few cores which were overclocked so we could use them for single-threaded stuff, that'd be great
My gaming PC at home is literally faster than any PC we have in the company
Why can't they just give us SSDs in our laptops?!?!??!?!?
 wtf
But my PC takes about 10 mins to boot up
I could complete my job on 2GB of RAM, it just took me all dya
3k gaming PC lmao
There's no point paying more than about £1.5k
You don't get any increased performance
I already have a kickass PC at home, I just wish I could use it for work purposes
I would use a VPN, but it ruins my gaming experience on my desktop, and prevents me from using Adguard on my mobile
How do I route the majority of my traffic through the VPN, but whitelist things such as Steam?
 I can't play online games over a VPN lmao
Low ping is way too important
Looks like a lot of hassle
Yeah or maybe one PC for gaming and one PC for everything else
IDK that seems less convenient
Rebooting too much inconvenience
CBA
 Should I buy this? http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-52200112.html
I can if I save up
 I earn 19k a year, so it'll only take me 6 years to save up for it
lmao
Okay
8k a year then
It'll only take me 14 years to save up for it
k
Will be 38 though
38 and still living with my parents....
Do you think my parents will mind?
They kicked my older brother out when he was 16
For smoking cannabis
 IDK some sort of computer programmer
 He does the computer programming
 lmao no my brother has a wife
And he's a few years older
And has a house
LMAO the new girl sitting next to me is listening to music using Ipod earphones
And I'm sitting here using my Beyerdynamic DT770s like a boss
Apple customers are ignorant to high performance products
When shit is all they know, they think it's fine
If you give Apple shitphones to a gorilla, does it complain that you didn't give it beyerdynamics?
?
 Why not 970?
970 is the sweetspot
How much do 960 cost normally?
I might sell my 970 to my friend when Pascall is released later this year
My friend needs a new GPU
And I want a new GPU so I can downscale Street Fighter from 4k to 1080p
Ah I guess a 960 for 100 is okay if you're on a budget
What games are you running on it?
And what resolution is your monitor?
Hmmmm I guess you'll be okay then
IDK what sort of GPU you need for that game
I hate how some games have really shitty AA which just blurs the screen, so I have to disable it to get a sharp image
I would just downsample them from 4k, but my 970 isn't quite fast enough
If you bought a 970 in 2014, it would be fine until at least mid-2016
Nothing has been released in 2 years
I think the same price it is now
£250
It won't go down until new cards are released
It's still one of the best cards you can buy
Me too, but the Pascall equivalent
Every time I've upgraded my PC I've underestimated how much power I want/need, and then always craved more
wtf is a log apocalypse?
I'm pissed off that I spent £1,000 on my PC and can only run CS:GO at 400FPS
What rank are you?
 Why?
Filthy casual
wow it's amazing how tech-illiterate company directors can be. I just read an email chain about a director struggling to type our web address into their web browser
They kept trying to type it into google and it led them to the wrong site lmao

The garage did some more work on my car today, hopefully water won't leak into my boot any more.
I won't know whether it's fixed until there's lots of heavy rain
I want to put my car back together
It's a massive mess ATM because it's all opened up to make it easier to work on
Spare wheel, parcel shelf, boot carpet all on the back seats
And lots of newspaper everywhere
Interior panels stripped off
It's a fucking mess right now, but I can't put it together until the problem is fixed
2016-03-03 17:30:00 Lord-Harlot  [17:11:27]  (+davehamil) I won't know whether it's fixed until there's lots of heavy rain << I'd just pour a bunch of water over it
wtf if she is complaining about me not writing down her instructions, why didn't she just email me instead!??!
no why?
Following so many channels is hard
I am at work
Don't have time to slack off
I want lots of heavy rain so I can check if they've fixed my leaking car
Easier to leave it out in the rain. The garage had been going over it with a hose pipe or whatever they used, and then it rained and got wet
 I am using my Beyer DT770s and HTC One M9's built-in DAC at work :)
I might buy the Samsung Galaxy S7 if the DAC is good
 Do you think it will have a good DAC?
Fuck external DACs
Hmmmm
Well there's lots of phones with really powerful amps but still sound like shit
http://www.phonearena.com/phones/benchmarks
See
I'm happy as long as the phone provides as much amplification as my HTC One M9, and has a great DAC
My grandfather says he's voting anti-EU. Fucking selfish though, because the consequences aren't even going to affect him since he's old as fuck
The fucking retarded thing is that all these super old pensioners are going to vote anti-EU, then they're gonna die and we're gonna be the ones to deal with it
I vote the UK leaves London
Give us a referendum on that
I think we should leave the EU and join China instead
Or Korea
Chinese girls are really nice
I want my student loan overpayments refunded
Got to wait until the end of the tax year though......
Then need my P60 or P800 or whatever the fuck it is that tells me my total earnings
Then send it to the Student Loans Company
Took all my accrued holiday pay in one go
And had a shitload deducted for student loan repayment
Then I became unemployed
And student loan company doesn't refund you automatically like HMRC does for tax
You have to chase them to get it repaid
It's funny how I am in massive debt but trying to save up for a mortgage deposit to put myself in massive debt to another organisation
I'm going to be perpetually in debt my entire life at this rate
I'm envious of people who never went to uni and just got housing benefit at 18
No debt for them
lmao I doubt it
The Job Centre told me I will never get housing benefit because I am a young white straight male
lmao daily mail doesn't give a fuck, I'm not their target demographic
It wasn't just the job centre who told me, it was the housing association too
10 minutes is already a long time for retail...
It needs to be 10 seconds
The woman next to me keeps speaking to herself
It's so annoying
It freaks me out
She keeps saying "I'm not happy with this"
I just did 40 mins of cardio
I could have done more, but I ran out of lunch hour
Had to get back to Reddit
No, took it at 14:30
I think I've taken it at 16:00 before
Once
I usually go down around 13:30-14:30
Then do an hour

wtf since when does HMRC care about people living with their parents?
k then I'm telling the police you buy, handle and consume illegal drugs
But how will we have slumber parties at my house if none of you know my address?!?!??
What are you talking about?
Red Orchestra?
Is that like Roller Coaster Tycoon?
Or Prison Simulator?
 Sounds like Sim City
Is it esports?
I only play esports now
strategic diversity, burden of knowledge, toxicity
burden of knowledge increased toxicity by 9001%!

I made my own packed lunch this morning!
detachable cable mod for my DT770s would be sick
I wish the cable wasn't so fucking long

Aren't my AKG K702s just as good as your HD600s, but half the price?
I use my DT770s at home and at work

My k702's comfort and soundstage are ridiculously good
Yeah but you want to get the most amazing soundstage
I wanted the best soundstage for gaming
So I went with K702 because they have the biggest soundstage ever
Yeah but how?
I mean
Did the dean randomly find the video whilst browsing?
lmao
One of the students is a pervert
When looking for headphones for gaming, soundstage is the most important thing
Which is why I bought K702
I bought a modmic too, but it keeps falling off and it's less convenient having two separate cables is annoying and they get tangled more often
I wish gaming headsets were less shit
Can't tell if you're being serious....
There's a couple of semi-decent ones, like the Audio Technica one and the Sennheiser one
Yeah they're gamer headsets
https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjF4-zr1K7LAhVkDJoKHWvTClMQFggiMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen-uk.sennheiser.com%2Fgame-one&usg=AFQjCNGmKReLCz5TCGss-CF6ZBNLl6c01Q&sig2=IZOhDeeQpxkuEt99bx3MCA&bvm=bv.116274245,d.bGs
http://en-uk.sennheiser.com/game-one
The problem is that OEM headphones suck, and AKG don't want to enter the gaming headset market
OSSIC say they're developing the best gaming headphones ever
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/248983394/ossic-x-the-first-3d-audio-headphones-calibrated-t
I'm keeping an eye on it
I need to decide what mouse to buy
I'm looking at the Zowie ZA11, Zowie EC1A and the Finalmouse Scream One atm
Light and large with a great sensor is what I want
The main problem I find with gaming audio is that developers are ignoring OpenAL Soft HRTF
yay going to the board meeting tomorrow
I am the butler lmao
hahahahha
We'll find out
My manager is pretty pleased with me so far
LMFAO a pro Dota player's car keys for his MASERATI were stolen by the event organisers
What do you mean by "full circle"?
There are no dota event staff; there are dozens of different organisations
This is the organiser https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_World_(company)
They're shit
Valve won't be working with them again
WHAT DO THE ARROWS MEAN
You mean convergence?
It's what happens when young people get very rich very fast
They buy expensive cars
Yeah it's changed a lot over the last 5 years
Ever since Valve announced a $1.6m tournament for Dota 2
That's when the money starting getting big
Yeah but it was over $18m last year
And this year they're doing 4 tournaments instead of 1
Nothing will ever reach Football levels though
It's called free2play business model
Supported by microtransactions rather than selling boxed copies
Probably kept it alive though?
TF2 would be dead like DoD if it wasn't for F2P
Wanna play Overwatch with me and rory when it launches?
Blizzard's new FPS game
It's not an arena FPS
And it's nothing like SMITE lmao
Arena FPS is like UT/Quake/Warsow/Reflex/etc
It's not a moba omg
SMITE is nothing like an FPS
Overwatrch is nothing like SMITE or League of Legends ffs
Do you realise that SMITE only has horizontal movement and aiming?
I'd say it's more like Skyrim than SMITE and LoL
It's similar to TF2 though
ffs people are asking me why I'm laughing and I have to give them some excuse rather than tell them I'm laughing at the stupidity of someone in IRC
omg Overwatch is nothing like a fucking moba
stop telling him that
June I think
Just because the characters have abilities you think it's a fucking moba wtf
Why do you need one?
ffs at least tag it NSFW
The XP key is piracy?
Pretty sure warez is NSFW
wtf
I smoked some cheese
wtf is gouda
Overwatch release date announced
24th May 2016
The Manila Major was just announced
$3m prizepool, Manila, cheap-as-fuck tickets, Alodia Gosiengfiao, PGL production
Gonna be sick
shrekt
It's amazing how a country with such fit girls can fuck up esport event organisation so badly
My peasant friend was trying Dota last night. I told him to be careful of Zeus. He asked me who is Zeus? I told him he's a fictional god, but not as fictional as the god in the major religions.
At least we know what zeus fucking looks like

What are you doing?
filthy casual
Money can't buy you a sexy Korean gf or good gaming skills m9

Valve has only been catering to the filthy casuals in TF2
lmao TF2 has a "hardcore fan base"?
....
TF2 is still full of casuals
Games with actual hardcore playerbases include Dota, Starcraft, and Quake
How do I search a column for a value of "1" then output the value of another cell on that row into a seperate spreadsheet?
No, I don't want to count

Nope, don't want it to align
wtf is nest
Yeah but it's what I need to do...
I want to present the most important calculations nicely on a single page
IDK what you're saying TBH m9
I want to IF(X1=1) then give me the value of A3 but in a single cell in spreadsheet 5
hmmm that could work
wtf is a pivot table
lmao yeah I did the pivot table on the Excel online test thing, but IDK what it does
wtf I was told that the board would be having lunch at 12:40 and that I should go replenish the refreshments, but it looks like they've already had lunch!!!!!!
I'm so fucked
nvm
They had lunch early, wasn't my fault
hahahahha I stole the leftovers
Na, I just volunteered to do it
So I get first-helpings of the scraps
lmao
Now you can do live kernel updates, you can get infinite uptime!!!!!
I wish I didn't eat any leftovers pre-workout
only 40, did it at the end of a full-throttle full-body workout with my PT
So I'm pretty knackered

I don't want to comment on illegal drugs at work and lose my job lmao
 What joke?
Annyoung rory
wtf
Don't be racist please
I would never date a fat girl
wtf is OCC
same
New job and stuff
test
I like EC1-A
EC1-A is a very good gaming mouse
EC2-A is good too, but I have big hands so I prefer the bigger EC1-A
It sucks
palm if the mouse is big enough
Kinda hard to palm with my big hands...
Mice are usually too small
MMOs suck
They're good when you're unemployed
But they suck once you find a job
Schoolkids and unemployed people
Not working adults like us
My time is spent working and sleeping and commuting and doing adult stuff and playing videogames
What make and model?
I doubt they're as good as my Shure SE215s
But I think my SE215s sound like trash compared to my DT770s
But my SE215s are a lot more portable
And work better in the gym
I don't want to  get my DT770s all sweaty
How much did they cost?
They don't look terrible, but Dunu DN-1000 is probably better for that sort of money
I generally dislike IEMs, I just like how portable they are
I can keep them in my pocket
But I think they all sound like trash
Do you ever use company Wi-Fi to stream music?
I downloaded Office 2016 the other day. Should I use Office 2016 or Libreoffice 5.0?
Yeah but which do you prefer?
lmao
Yeah I guess so
Does MS support all libre functionality?
Does it run on Linux?
wtf
wtf
Why?
If I put money on my supermarket card, is it deducted from my salary pre-tax?
?!?!??
Oh I have to pay by debit card
Can't get it paid from my salary
It seems like a lot of hassle and lost interest just to get a slight reduction off the cost of bottled water and energy drinks
For Some reason filtering isn't enough, I'm being asked to copy paste the values to another document
I always get asked to do easy tasks in really hard ways for some reason
wtf is a "copy spreadsheet" anyway?
wtf does "information to be sorted in a different way" mean?
wtf do "tabs" mean?
Why do I have to copy and paste relevant lines into another document instead of just deleting the few lines that aren't needed?!?!?!?
sorted in what way though?!??!?!?!?!?
Chronological? Alphabetical?!?!??!
Yes it was....
She just left the office
I sorted it by chronological, since it seems the most likely way
I'm 90% sure I did it right
But it's weird being told to "sort it a different way" and not being told how to sort it.....
But there's like 20 different columns....
yes
probably
Especially since I was asked to delete lines outside of a specific date range
Isn't saying "sort by date/chronologically" just as easy as saying "sort in a different way"?
I am not a tech person
I am not in IT either!!!!
IT is behind me
Is a 1% pay increase low?
office job
I work in an office
Procurement
Yeah
Yeah it's big business around here
Lots of people in social housing
Can I what?
That sentence doesn't make sense
./ignore
No I was just letting you know I ignored you
lmao been on Reddit all day and my manager just asked me if I'm being overworked
KFC TOMORROW OMG
Big Daddy
haha yes
Biggest and best value!
So much better than what you'd get at McDonalds for the same money
Anchovies probably
Or some other fish
Annyoung rory
I'm going to visit my Korean gf tomorrow
IDK, she demands I plan everything
But she has more time than me
How is that fair!??!?
omg
She's so needy
She thinks I have to do everything for her lmao
And she calls me "self-centered" wtf
Internet
wtf
wtf
She is KOREAN
lmao
Once you go Korean or Chinese, you never go back.
better
I can't give you the full list of reasons without getting fired for racism
As long as they're a fatty?
wtf no it's not
My parents are really angry with me for dating a foreigner
omg this stupid elevated monitor on top of the laptop dock is forcing bad posture on me
I have to sit up straight and look up slightly
And the stupid third-story building with all the stairs is bad for my leg DOMS too
I just renewed my Spotify student subscription for another 12 months ^^
What?
I just got back from KFC
I got this https://www.kfc.co.uk/our-food/for-one/box-meals/the-big-daddy
1430 calories holy shit
And that's excluding the drink
Why is everyone I'm working with insisting that spreadsheets are actually called "tabs" and workbooks are called "spreadsheets"?
And they get confused when I use correct terminology wtf
He talks a lot
Reminds me of my gf. I go play a match of Dota and come back to find 10 massive messages left by my gf
lmao when he said his mum died and he was double booked with another girl
Probably fake
"I'm a doctor, my brain thinks at a higher lever than yours or an average person" lmao
He probably has a fedora
Hometime for me in 60 mins!!!
Because I am in another office
I get to drive home earlier
I've never owned a credit card, is that a bad thing?
Is that the only reason to get one then?
lmao
"when"?
What if it never happens?!?!?
I am the youngest, so I will be last-in-line to inherit anything :(
Except for my nephew I guess
Or my cousin
Damn, I don't want it to be shared!
My brother doesn't need a house, he already has one
ffs noddle doesn't work for me because I'm not registered to vote or something
IDK how do I check?
Sounds like a lot of hassle
CBA
What ISAs?
No I mean why do I need to get my ISAs ready?
So what do I need to do?
I have a Halifax Help to Buy ISA already
Why?
I can only pay £200 a month into it :(
I will be paying £200 a month into it for the next 4 years, then I will look into buying a house
Unless my gf fucks up my plans
I'm limited to depositing £200 a month
With the £500 tax-free interest allowance, do ISAs even matter any more?
You can get better interest on current accounts
lmao like what?
Did you know that a Lannister Always Pays His/Her Debts?
Annyoung rory
Nice, I will be too soon!
I'm going to visit my Korean gf today :)
But I forgot to bring condoms and a toothbrush omg
I don't have time
Have to drive over to Brighton straight from work
wtf
Reported
wtf
oh god pls no
If she gets deported, I won't have to?
that sucks
lmao same
lmao
lmao
This is getting a bit NSFW
I quite like being able to barely afford rent
If I had to pay child support, I could become homeless and lose my job
Then lose my child support from my JSA, not have enough leftover to feed myself, and die of starvationb
So if I make my gf pregnant, I will just kill myself instead
ffs my gf is telling me to buy them myself
Because she doesn't have any free time or money or something
I don't want to stop at a shop
I might just tell her I'm not visiting her any more
I forgot to pack them
IDK that sounds like quite a reasonable reaction
Reported and muted
Maybe you have no aims in your life and need to look after another human being to gain any sense of self-worth?
IDK what's the usual reason people want babies?
Really? You don't sound like a very ambitious person. I have lots of aims, such as becoming Global in CS:GO
How old are you?
haha Iota may need to get some amnesia
You said something about getting your penis snipped off when you turn 30?
ffs why do these domestic violence charities only work for women?
What about men?
They are collecting money for different Domestic Abuse charities in different offices, but I want my money to go to the one which offers services to men
What?
He sounds like a pretentious neckbeard FUCK
Annyoung
The same guy who says "darta"?
I know about port forwarding because I play video games
And torrents
How much does your gf weigh?
Just wondering
Got a pic?
My gf is quite tall too
I wouldn't want a gf any taller though
I'm just wondering what a 220kg girl looks like
hahaha did you get a bit excited there?
But heart disease and diabetes isn't?
omg that's so cool
I wonder what a 220lbs girl looks like
btw there's a meal at KFC called Big Daddy which is 1430 calories + a drink
I think that could lead to some NSFW results
I'm really interested in what is wrong with your Brian which makes you think obesity is an attractive trait
Thanks!
I got my PC to work after 5.5 hours, but I broke the USB3 socket on my motherboard :(
Also, I broke the CPU fan cable by letting the fan blade rip it apart
I bent the pins on the motherboard....
I pushed it in and bent them somehow
So now only one of the USB sockets worked
I tried that, but I just broke it off....
Why?
I will be more careful next time
Yeah same...
Just have to be super careful I guess
Maybe plug it in before mounting the motherboard in the case
Yeah I only use rear sockets anyway
I use the back of my PC like the front
I have it facing the side
I don't give a fuck about sexiness
I need performance
And convenience
The sexy stuff will be on my monitors
Yeah
Haven't used an optical disc for about 5 years now
There's no need anymore now that we have fast internet
Why do you like fat girls?
Was your mum fat?
IDK average I think
Have you been to see a psychiatrist?
Annyoung rory
omg the Samsung Galaxy S7 looks srsly fucking good
A grill let me try on Samsung VR in Brighton on Saturday
The resolution and colours looked a bit shit
Yeah she offered to give me a demo
Are there any reviews of the S7's DAC yet?
If the DAC is good, I'm definitely going to buy it in 6+ months
Unless HTC or Sony come out with something better
One thing I don't like about the S7 is the glass back. Glass backs are stupid because they are slipperier, easier to break, and attract fingerprints and smudges
wtf is that?
That was a risky google search
No, it was the phone shop
02 I think
If you drop it, the glass might shatter!
I use this case on my HTC One M9 https://static1.squarespace.com/static/550a10cbe4b03c7ec206488b/55165994e4b0617803521710/5516599ce4b0617803523fd6/1348613695793/1000w/urban_armor_gear_uag_iphone_5_cases.jpg
It's not true for the Motorolla Droid Turbo 2
That phone is shatterproof
What page?
But are there actually any DAC reviews yet?
You can have the best DAC in the world, but if there's shitloads of electronic interference then it doesn't matter
I'm thinking of buying Philips Fidelio X2
It looks nice
The S7 is for sale now though?
meme wtf?
How are they meme?
Audio quality is an afterthought on every smartphone, nobody gives a fuck!
They're "trash tier" now because they have a problem with the production
But they're very nice headphones, like my AKG K702 but with an aux cable instead of this SLXR crap
wtf does "meme tier" even mean?
I haven't heard anything about HD600s being good for gaming
I only buy open headphones which are good for gaming
Sounds ogod
But are they better for gaming than K702s or X2s?
AKG K702 is only £136 on Amazon now, which is amazing
wtf you have so many misconceptions about gaming
bass is bad for gaming!!!!!!
Gaming is all about soundstage and detail and balanced EQ
Yeah gaming audio marketing is pretty bad
Gaming mice too
Some gaming mice are full of useless features like 10,000 DPI and LEDs and customisable weights etc lmao
Yeah it's not
But my fucking modmic keeps falling off
If I get the Philips X2s, then I can use this with it http://www.amazon.co.uk/V-MODA-BoomPro-Gaming-Headphone-Microphone-Black/dp/B00BJ17WKK
So it won't fall off like my fucking modmic
And I won't have two cables
I don't think I can justify the cost, as I already have AKG K702s+Modmic
Yeah agreed
I think I'll pass on upgrading my audio gear this year, and get a Pascall GPU instead
And maybe a Samsung Galaxy S7 or HTC One M10 or something....
Pascall definitely
There'll be lots of cheap GTX970s on ebay soon
Depends on how much power you want/need
Yep, GTX970 is a great card
The problem is that I don't have unlimited money
But how much power do you actually need/want?
Depends on what games
A GTX970 should do that wityh pretty much any game though
I run CS:GO at 1080p with 4xAA at 400FPS
On my GTX970
nVidia is better for Linux
Well nVidia is a binary blob, but the performance is unrivaled
But what about in the future?
You might want to
maybe
I only buy Linux-friendly hardware
Low cost, low power-draw, high performance
When Pascall launches
https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=pascal+release+date
I think Q2 2016
I'm probably going to sell mine and upgrade to Pascal
A shitload of people have 2 year old GTX970s right now, so there'll be a shitload of second-hand ones on ebay when Pascal launches for sure
You can probably pick up an amazing card for dirt cheap
I want to sell my 4690K and buy a 6700K
Trying to get 500+ FPS in CS:GO is really fucking hard
Stuck at 400 ATM :(
The 4690K?
PCI-E graphics cards fit in pretty much any motherboard AFAIK
You should check your PSU is decent enough though
Although it's not too power-demanding
Have you ever considered building a m-itx rig?
I have more space on my desk now ^^
There's something really fascinating about cramming as much power as possible into as small a space as possible...
m-itx rigs can be just as powerful as full-size ATX rigs
I've considered that too
lmao yeah or a NUC or something
Or even a fucking phone
I just want a 7-15 litres incredibly powerful rig
To get 999FPS in CS:GO
Looks like the S7 has the fastest camera http://www.phonearena.com/phones/benchmarks
But not a lot of headphone amp...
.l

I probably wouldn't be so fucking frustrated with Windows's stacking window manager if there was just a fucking "always on top" button on the window bar
.L
How do I toggle "always on top" for my windows?
On Windows
I'm not allowed to install software on my work PC
I want to keep my IRC window on top of others
My manager doesn't even work at my office

brb gym
wtf is that?
Are those jokes supposed to be funny?
Because it's not fucking funny
You have more in common with Minecraft players than me
There isn't really a defined "gamer" demographic any more, it's become too diverse
I haven't, no
Minecraft is on the casual spectrum, like LoL
But really far along
It tries to be lego and dungeonquest
Hitbox is HTML5 4k 60fps now lmao
Probably runs better than Twitch on Medium settings lmao
Valve has done that with CS:GO guns recently...
It pisses me off
They make the weapon OP to sell skins
Or at least, that's the conspiracy
Do you prefer full disk encryption or home folder encryption for personal use?
The one on the right looks a bit better, but still pretty bad
But you don't encrypt the root directory?
Ah okay
I think I will just use Ubuntu home directory encryption
And mount /tmp and /usr/tmp to tmpfs
I can just backup on dropbox or something
My Steam games are backed up on Steam, and my TV shows/films are backed up on Stremio, and music on Spotify
Only 3,333 Spotify songs
I've fully embraced the cloud for media now
I used to have offline media collections, but it is less convenient
I love Stremio and Spotify now
I don't rewatch stuff I've already watched most of the time anyway
CBA to say online distribution or peer to peer downloading
u wot m9
The textures on the ground and trees look really bad
Like I'm looking at them through a blur-filter
Football is full of corruption and terrible people
The sport is a complete joke at this point
Can't zoom in
So you sent me the entire map through a blur-filter?
http://dota2.cyborgmatt.com/Dota2_Downscale01.jpg
Look at the trees
But they actually have leaves on them
They don't look like a single object
Nobody who actually plays Dota has ever complained about that
It looks a lot nicer
lmao
Faster horses would still be good
You are such a sucker for Riot propaganda. Don't you realise that it is just excuses to not improve the game?
Denying is burden of knowledge, voice chat is toxic, graphical improvements is too confusing, etc
Bigger free hero pool burden of knowledge
Stable client is toxic
In-game spectating is too confusing
etc
I can't take anyone seriously who says that
"stable client is in alpha" LMAO
Oxymoron, right?
If I go create a LoL account now, how many heroes can I play? 110?
How many cursors does LoL have?
lmao
Dota has hundreds
How much money have you made selling in-game cosmetic items?
I've made about £1,000
£230 from one item
In most countries in the world living with your parents is not shameful
It's the same business model for Dota
Selling hats
Except Dota does it without locking any of the gameplay behind a paywall
wtf
Yeah because obviously the UK has the best social norms in the world
It's not as if being unemployed or poor or dating a foreigner or playing video games is shameful or anything
Or drinking sugar-free energy drinks
My mum gives me so shit for drinking a can of sugar-free energy drinks once a day, but she thinks drinking a bottle of wine every night is fine
Yes, I will just play my video games and drink energy drinks like a well-adjusted adult
no
It's to get high I think
My friend is always trying to get me to take them
It's been making a comeback recently, I'm not sure if it's still trending
wtf are "head shops"?
wtf are smoke shops?
Never seen one
wtf is a Camden
I've been to Brighton
Why not just call it London then?
wtf is a goth shop
wtf is a goth
a member of a Germanic people that invaded the Roman Empire from the east between the 3rd and 5th centuries. The eastern division, the Ostrogoths, founded a kingdom in Italy, while the Visigoths went on to found one in Spain.
lmao that just leaves me even more confused
Vincent van Gogh?
He should have picked a better name then
man I can't tell if you're trolling me
wtf is bint?
He was a womaniser?
So he cut his ear off to have more company with woman?!??!
Because of women?
But that's nothing to do with Camden?
Because he was Dutch, not German
Have you ever been to chinatown?
nice
did you like it?
Do you like Korean food?
nice
Is it real Korean cuisine if my Korean gf makes it for me?
lmao
You gonna pre-order Overwatch and play the open beta with me?
lmao you don't have any savings for impulse purchases?
IDK how you can live paycheck to paycheck like that
What if you get ill and can't go to work any more?
You will not have enough money to pay for rent and food and things
For how many months?
You need an emergency fund!!!!!!
You need a large amount of liquid assets in case you lose your job or unable to work
My mum told me that if I move out, I will never be allowed to move back in
So if I move out and don't pass my probation and lose my job, I will have to sleep on the street
Yeah but then what if I get seriously ill and can't go to work?
Then I don't get paid
Then I can't pay rent
Then I get evicted
Then I die on the streets
So why should I trade up a guaranteed roof over my head?
FPS genre
Virtual reality
High framerates
PC gaming
People used to play Quake at 125FPS on >60hz CRTs
Then LCDs came along at 60hz
Now people are buying more 120hz+ displays
If the police seize your computer hardware, do they have to refund the value of the parts?
Or are they just allowed to steal your shit?
Annyoung rory
I'm trying out DEs atm
Just tried Gnome Shell
IDK if I like it....
I don't like multiple workspaces, or a hidden taskbar
I might just stick with Unity
This is pretty cool though https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/
https://extensions.gnome.org/
It's like Firefox addons for your DE!?!?!?
Yeah I've used KDE before
I think I prefer Gnome/GTK programs
 Not sure, how new is KDE5?
I think KDE is overclutterd?
I'm waiting for 16.04 to release before installing it
How do I change virtualbox to a bigger display resolution?
Why?
What do they do?
Does it allow me to play games at high FPS?
I might install a Windows 10 virtual machine inside Ubuntu to play certain games
Can I play Crysis inside a virtual machine?
Is there any loss of performance though?
lmao that's not what I mean
Can I play games in a virtual machine without losing FPS?
Can I run a virtual machine inside a virtual machine too?
Some games don't run in WINE....
Can I run a virtual machine inside a virtual machine inside a virtual machine?
But can I run a VM in a VM in a VM in a VM in a VM?
But how do you get to the 4th depth without going through the third?
https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2z0evz/gpu_passthrough_or_how_to_play_any_game_at_near/
I will when I get the time
Do you think there are stripped-down versions of Windoze you can download just for running games?
So low storage and low cpu cycles and stuff?
I don't want to run a full-fledged OS in a VM just to run a game
Oh god I just read the guide and it looks convoluted as fuck
IDK if I CBA with it
It doesn't look ideal for playing games on both Linux and virtual machine
You have to dedicate a GPU just to the virtual machine it seems
There aren't many Windoze-only games which I actually want to play nowadays. It's just Overwatch really
If Overwatch gets ported over to Linux, then I can uninstall Windoze
But Blizzard need to port Battle.net and all thatshit first....
Why?
wow nice
Do you have a job?
I need some Excel help
=COUNTIF(Response!F3:F999,"<TODAY()-7")
But it's picking up cells with words in them
How do I exclude it from picking up "Sole Trader"?
What am I doing wrong? =IF(Response!F3:F999<TODAY()-7,IF("<>Sole Trader", 1, 0),0)
lmao
Why don't you have a job?
What's with the random quote?
I have money now, I just have to wait for my 12 month monthly saver to expire and I get £3.6k!
Plus interest!
Gonna build a fucking amazing gaming PC
6700K, liquid nitrogen cooling, GTX1080TITAN
Why is building a powerful computer a poor decision?
It's not like I'm wasting it on drugs
What's the point of saving money if you're never going to spend it?
Spending money is the ultimate aim of saving money
Opportunity cost
I probably won't spend £3.6k on a gaming PC, I just need a faster CPU, CPU cooler and GPU
And I need a 200hz 21:9 monitor
It's true though
10ms of latency will always be better than 50ms
There's diminishing returns of course
But lower is always better
I just got an openmailbox account
Now Microsoft can't open my email folder and look at everything whenever they feel like
I use Thunderbird
I just created a ProtonMail account, but it doesn't support IMAP and I hate using a web browser for email
So I looked for a better alternative and found openmailbox
http://i.imgur.com/t7NaZQl.jpg
Why do you use Protonmail instead of openmailbox?
Openmailbox supports IMAP
St. Patrick's Day was yesterday, dumbass.
How hyped are you for Overwatch?
ANNYOUNG RORY
ANNYOUNG IOTA
wtf why?
They should have sent you in January, so you could go to Starladder LAN!
It's funny how shit little countries like Belarus get amazing LANs, but the UK gets fuck all esports events
Are you going to try any of the locals?
lmao
What email provider do you use?
Do you use protonmail?
But Google and the NSA are reading your emails!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
You need openmailbox or protonmail m9
So?
no
Have you eaten a kangaroo? They're really fucking tasty
haha McDonalds?
You should go to KFC and get the 2,000 calories Big Daddy meal for £6
haha you totally should m9
LMAO
What, why?
I saw a couple of their posts made it to the top of /r/all
But I don't live in NA
And NA is really anti-immigration, so I can't move there anyway
Which is weird, since modern NA is made up of immigrants
And now they don't want more
lmao 10% is great, I'm only getting 1%
No, outside is scary and dangeorus
5.6% wtf
I get 1% £190
Actually IDK if it'll even go up at all since I am on probation
Best case £190, worst case £0 lmao
haha nice
Better than not having a job
I think my mum just got a pay cut of like £10k
They gave her a choice, either lose 50% of her salary or be fired
The housing sector is in shambled
shambles
unban me from #ubuntu-offtopic pls
Yeah then maybe I will have enough money to financially support my Korean gf
She wants to live with me and marry me next year
wtf I thought we were friends
rory omg
did you like that photo I sent you last night?
I put it in the channel last night omg
Yesterday evening
I shared a pic of my gf with the channel
2016-03-18 16:05:35 +Iota 20:59:02     +davehamil | http://i.imgur.com/t7NaZQl.jpg
Pun intended?
She's pretty, right?
Yes!!!!
pun intended?
You know what you're doing omg
There's no way you could do it twice without it being intentional
It's an illusion of the photo I think
You can't see all her hair
Good detective work
Yeah I knew you were trolling me
Because you almost had a "heart attack" and then you acted "confused"
This is you http://imgur.com/n8umjWj
Didn't know you were such an AOA fan
"manufactured" lmao
You're such a hater
You're wrong, it's aimed at an international audience
sec, lemme find my source
http://www.inaglobal.fr/en/music/article/k-pop-story-well-oiled-industry-standardized-catchy-tunes
The government then identified the cultural industry as the next growth driver. Numerous state research agencies were created and some projects were subsided in an attempt to boost the nationâ€™s cultural industry.
Government initiatives to expand the popularity of K-pop are mostly undertaken by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, which is responsible for the establishment of dozens of Korean Cultural Centers worldwide.
As part of the Korean Wave, K-pop has been embraced by the South Korean government as a tool for soft power abroad, particularly towards youth.[266]
With the growing acceptance of YouTube during the late-2000s as a popular music sharing platform, K-pop has since become increasingly well known in many parts of the world, including the West.[268]
K-pop artists are now gaining more international exposure through social media networks such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, making it easier for them to reach a wider audience.[80]
srsly though my gf looks a lot like her
Kpop is the best genre of music in the world because it has the highest production value.
Annyoung rory
I've started resting my arms on my desk and taken the arms off my chair
The stupid chair arms aren't adjustable, so they just get in the way
I think resting my arm on the desk is probably better for accuracy anyway
Who is going to Thailand
lmao a Korean team won an international Dota LAN last night
No, they've never won before
They've come top 8
And Navi came top 4 lmao
wtf why does it seem like Spotify only plays the same 50 songs out of my 3,000 track playlist?
lmao same
wtf how?
How do you have so much debt?
lmao but how?
That's so much money
Sausage rolls wtf?
Is that some kind of euphamism?
Are you a sausage-gobbler?
I have £4,500 in savings now ^^
Gonna have even more after I get paid
fuck you and your puns
How?
How will you beat my interest?
20% APR lmao
But I thought your salary was double mine, so how are you in so much debt?
lmao I had 3 months off work and worked 2 day weeks
I just didn't buy anything
Maybe next time you're unemployed you should not buy anything
Yeah but if you get hit by a bus or something
What were you doing off work then?
Why were you unemployed at 14 wtf
LMFQAO
lmao
what were you sick of
aids wtf
are you serious?
wtf how did you get aids?
wtf
Are you serious?
I'm a Master Guardian Elite, so I'm pretty fucking socially-able, thank you very much m9
I'm an esports athlete m9
Only fucking casuals play for fun
Why is womens' tennis so big?
Yeah it's weird
The female players are so much worse than men
yeah it's weird
You creep me out man
I'm thinking about buying some budget headphones just to remind myself how good my audiophile phones are
I think I might be so used to good sound quality that I take it for granted and I've forgotten what shit sounds like
exactly!!!!!!1
Hmmmmm I still have my Corsair Vengeance 1500 headset somewhere
I might plug it in and see what it sounds like now
Get a 500GB SSD for £90
I think 3TB 3.5" HDDs are like £40 nowadays?
They're super cheap
http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00QGFEQXU/?tag=pcp0f-21
http://www.novatech.co.uk/products/components/harddrives-internal/sata3tbto4tb/Toshiba/DT01ACA300.html?#utm_source=affiliatewindow&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=PCPartPicker
I can't find a 4TB drive for cheaper than that
Why is it so cheap?
IDK I only use SSDs now
Not any more
Not worth the effort
I just delete films after I've watched them
I just watch them on Stremio
I used to be
I love it when my PC boots up before I turn on the monitors
What are your PC specs?
8GB is fine
My current PC has 10X as much RAM as my first PC's hard drive space
Windoze process monitor tells me I use over 6GB usually
But for new builds there's not much reason not to go with 16GB, since it's so cheap
The 16GB in my build gives me lots of peace-of-mind that I will have enough for a long time
Losing weight would be so much easier if my mum didn't put so much food in my lunchbox omg
I bought a packet of beef jerkey at the weekend!!!!!!
It's £3 for only a small packet, but beef jerkey is amazing!!!!!!
Because my mum does
lmao did you see this? https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4b9im9/h3h3_the_leafy_rant/
A Youtuber who likes to bully children and people with mental disabilities
He sent his army of followers to bully and send death threats to an autistic man and then he got a massive backlash for it
I hope my gf isn't pregnant.
lmao I got a letter from the police at the weekend
It said I will be prosecuted because I went 40 in a 30 zone
I've installed Waze now, so it shouldn't happen again
I thought the zone was at least 40, since I didn't know the speed limit but the area didn't seem very built-up
It definitely didn't look like a 30 zone
It was on a really steep hill too
what I never said that
I can't fucking keep to the speed limit if I don't fucking know what the fucking speed limit fucking is omfg
fucking speed limit*
The £90 one?
Looks good if you want cheap storage
The flood has ruined quality?
Maybe if they manufactured them in a country with stable weather like the UK then we wouldn't have this problem
yay in a month from now my monthly salary will increase by £7.92
ME TOO OMG
Over £1,000 into my bank account ^^
So much money omg....
If I really wanted to, I could buy a Samsung Galaxy S7 EVERY month
I've read that the Snapdragon S7 DACs are really bad
But Snapdragon is only USA and China, and EU has Exygon
Yeah they're awful
I haven't been on holiday since I was about 16
15*
Then my parents stopped paying for me
lmao your a terrible human being
I like Asians
If you like shitposts, you should subscribe to /r/dota2
One of the best shitposts subreddits on reddit
Depends, the Chinese ones usually pay for themselves because they're so rich
In fact, my Chinese friend probably paid the majority of it for me
Yeah they're nice
My Chinese friend's parents bought her a house a few months ago. She had to go back to Beijing just to sign the legal paperwork
nice!
Did you see any fatties you liked?
lmao yeah
I lived in Swansea for 4 years
What uni are you at?
Why are you at a uni campus?
You definitely should m9
Swansea?
Cardiff?
Lmao it's Swansea, isn't it?
yes
That was every day for me, except it was my nephew screaming and running around all day
I thought I was going to die from sleep deprivation
I saw a Reddit thread about Redditors' parters' fetishes at the weekend. One girl said that her bf wanted her to gain weight, and all the replies were telling her how bad of an idea it is because it's so bad for her health
It's fucking weird and creepy and unnatural too
wtf
Quoting /r/askreddit gets you kicked now?
I want to be a Dota esports athlete and go to Shanghai and meet lots of beautiful grills
lmao
There's lots of pros older than me
Taz is 29
lol no, I'm nowhere near good enough
haha funny you should say that, I think I have a new bottleneck now
I think the climate control in my room is the bottleneck because I always have cold-as-fuck hands
Need to rent a new room
That's not a bad idea
I know, I go to the gym in my lunch hour most days
I don't do much at home though
It's just a better use of my lunch hour than going on Reddit
My HTC One M10 + Beyer DT770s are brilliant for the office
No wait, I have the M9
The M10 isn't released yet
I might buy the M10 if the DAC is better than the S7's
Are there any reviews of the S7's DAC yet? Have you upgraded to the S7?
wtf why don't you have a personal phone?
wtf why can't you?
They're on sale now
That's a nice benefit
I get issued a shitty Windoze phone I never use
But I have to carry it around with me all the time and keep it charged
buying phones on contract is stupid
HTC phones get A LOT of flak in /r/android
You pay more and you're less flexible if you buy phone and contract together
I pay £5 a month on my contract and £300 for my phone
If I bought them together, I'd be paying like £50 every month for two years
So over £1000
I bet you can't find an HTC One M9 on contract for anywhere near the price I paid
£528 http://www.moneysupermarket.com/mobile-phones/brands/htc/
I'm paying £420
expediateelectronics IIRC
Okay maybe it was £320 http://www.eglobalcentral.co.uk/htc-one-m9-32gb-4g-lte-sim-free-unlocked-silver-en.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjwt763BRDZx_Xg3-Pv2cABEiQAoDfeGB5y173tcE7kemode0WvmP5PSAEM9upLrmIT05SS6S8aAss48P8HAQ
Was about £320
So £440 in total
£5 a month contract
over 24 months
We're comparing oranges and oranges not apples and oranges
£22
So £528
£440<£528
500MB data, 200 minutes, unlimited texts
About all I need
Now that I've installed Waze, I might need to get more data
Stupid Waze has no offline maps wtf
I hope Waze caches a lot
Otherwise I'm fucked
It's cheaper to buy handset and contract seperately
And you don't get carrier bloatware
And don't have to pay the carrier to unlock the phone at the end
Okay next time I buy a phone, I will look at contract rates to make a price comparison
My mum pays for my phone contract though
The cheapest S7 contract I can find is £768
How is that cheaper than buying it standalone?
£29.99
Does that mean you have to pay for the handset too?
I could buy the phone for £560 on Amazon and £120 contract = £680
So I'd save £88
Big screens are good
As long as they still fit in your pocket ofc
The SIM equiv is £5 a month
£120 in total
Same 500MB as cheapest S7 contract
You can get 1GB for £5 now I think
Na, I'm waiting for a DAC review
And I want to see what HTC comes out with
No, I use my HTC One M9's built-in DAC
It has the best headphone output ATM
The phone is shit, but the DAC is really good
Yeah but CBA to carry it around with me
It's big and bulky and needs a battery
Built-in DACs are the future
My SE215s sound like shit
So I use my Beyers at home / in the office
SE215s good for when I'm at gym or walking around or whatever
Or when I can't take my beyers
I could get a pair of M50s too as they're fairly good travelphones
They fold up nicely
My DT770s don't really fold up at all
And the M50s are super comfortable if you rest them on your chest too
And detachable cable
M50s are really well designed
fuck on-ear
If you're gonna go on-ear you might as well go all the way and go over-ear
On-ear is stupid
If you want portability, get in-ear
On-ear just has the disadvantages of both over-ear and in-ear
IEMs are by far the most portable
Over-ears the best sound quality
And comfort
On-ears are bad portability, bad comfort, bad sound quality
They're just a retarded compromise
If you're going to ask a question, at least put a questionmark at the end
I didn't even realise it was a question
Which ones?
I never liked IEMs, bought my SE215s, still don't like them
both
Will they improve the tinny sound quality?
I CBA to change tips...
I think the fit is good
They just lack the mids and highs that my DT770s can produce
They don't sound awful
But I don't think IEMs are ever gonna sound as good as DT770s
I wore my DT770s in the gym once before buying my SE215s
Only did isolated lifts though, they'd get ruined if I did cardio
Well I kinda am Mr Moneybags, but I want to keep up payments into my monthly saver accounts as best as I can
In 6 months my First Direct account will expire leaving me with around £3,700 to spend
If I want to make any big purchases before then, I will have to take it out of one of my monthly savers
I'm worried that in a year or two I'm going to run out of space in my accounts to store my money
I'm not sure what I'll do then
Making more and more accounts would get unwieldly
And if I fuck up, I will lose interest or have to pay banking fees
ATM I only have 7 accounts, so it's manageable
Or is it 8?
3 monthly savers and 2 current accounts
And an idle account with £1 in it to stop FD charging me
lmao
Zootopia looks fucking amqazing
Or Zootropolis, whatever
Sausage Party looks amazing, you should go watch the trailer now
haha Grimsby looks funny
It looks like the film might be bad
Yeah
The trailer is good
I saw Deadpool with my gf
She hated it
Does anyone else get creeped out when girls younger than you have made babies?
Especially if the girl is 4 years younger than you but made a baby 4 years ago
cam versions suck
IDK just go on Stremio and look for something
I wish I was allowed holiday
oh shit, 4 day weekend coming up
Free holiday for me!
yay
Haven't had a holiday in so fucking long
Since Christmas
omg how do you get a free kebab!??!
£30 dinner allowance what the fuck
I get £0 wtf
I do omg
yes
wtf
£30 fucking dinner allowance
Actually maybe then
We can claim all sorts of shit as expenses
Mostly fuel and catering for meetings
lmao so you're going to spend £30 on a kebba?
kebab*
What will your boss think?
But you spent £30 on a kebab instead of £10-£15
Does the £30 include drinks?
I'd totally spend it on on soft drinks
But maybe just buy a couple of nice bottles?
If you had to go to Shanghai, would you get your expenses refunded?
if I had a £30 dinner budget, I would get a fancy 3 course meal
For £30 you could get a sweet 3 course meal with drinks
Only occassionally, unless you travel for the company every week
Just as a treat
lmfao
You could hire an escort to sit at the resteraunt with you
If you could fit it in your budget
If there an app for people to go to dinner together so they don't have to go to the restaurant alone?
holy shit label that NSFW omg
My manager almost saw that
Shit I gotta get to the gym before my next meeting
GYM TIME NOW BBL
My friend got a £400 all-inclusive holiday to Tunisia for 2 last summer
Then a fucking terrorist attack happened at his resort lmao
Just goes to show you get what you pay for!!!!!!!1
omg I found my new favourite Firefox plugin last night
I found a replacement for Tree Tab Style
Called Tab Tree
Most of the functionality is the same, but Tab Tree seems faster and more stable
Modern browsers have shit default tab functionality IMO
You can only have like 10 tabs on the tab bar before it becomes cluttered as fuck
Yeah it's WAY better
Seriously, I can't use Firefox without it
I have like 500 tabs open
Or just use Firefox instead?
Why the fuck are you using Chrome?
I recommend you use Firefox
No stupid UI
Proper window decorations
Proprietary window decorations suck
Mozilla takes your privacy more srsly too
I just opened an openmailbox email account
Because fuck Google and Microsoft
Looks like Chrome is taking over the browser market https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Usage_share_of_web_browsers_(Source_StatCounter).svg
Safari is growing share though, whatever Safari is
And mobile is growing too
Chrome, Safari and Mobile Chrome are growing, but Firefox and Internet Explorer are dying
IDK what Safari is
Safari is bigger than ever it seems
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers
Sad to see Firefox continuing to shrink
Ahhhh it's the iphone browser
That's why it's growing
A lot of them combine mobile and desktop chrome too
Isn't Edge just the new IE?
Firefox is best for power users
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-gb/firefox/addon/tab-tree/
That fucking addon
What I was using before https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/
I can't go back to normal browsers
That addon is just too fucking good
This one too https://addons.mozilla.org/en-gb/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/?src=search
Do you use it?
You should try this https://addons.mozilla.org/en-gb/firefox/addon/tab-tree/
"This extension was conceived as an alternative to Tree Style Tab to provide better performance, stability and usability."
Yeah same
I find it AMAZING for Reddit
I have my subreddits open, then open individual links under the tree
I only found out about Tab Tree yesterday :(
Yeah I moved it over to the left too
I had performance and stability problems with Tree Tab Style
Tree Tab Style is old as fuck now
Tab Tree has some nifty features like removing the title bar and shrinking the bezels at the top
And removing the tab bar when only one tab open
What do you mean by "It fits the way I browse Reddit"?
Just wondering if you browse Reddit like I do
hahaha yeah
I use Reddit front page as the root of the tree, then the subpages, then the pages, then click on the content of the reddit pages under the reddit posts!!!!
hahahaha yeah
It's sooooooo good
srsly IDK why everyone else isn't using it already
I can't live without it now
I'm going to ask my manager to give me desk display arms, so I can move my displays around, save space on the desk, and rotate them when I need to. My request will probably get denied, because they don't want to spend money on basic IT equipment :(
It's hard enough just asking them for a fucking £1 mouse
Had to bring in my own mousepad and keyboard
And then I was told I wasn't allowed to use my own keyboard :(
I did, then they got all bitchy about the noise my keyboard was making
They're only MX Reds ffs
Imagine if I brought in MX Blues lmao
Did you know that some people don't use any browser plugins? omg!!!!!
What do you think is best, Chinese, Korean or white?
wtf
How is it any different than ranking weight?
Can't tell if you're being serious
omg my manager just went to the shop to buy me a crossant
just in general
Yeah I like Chinese too
wtf
don't be creepy
900 million wtf
There's 1.36bn in China alone
Lots more outside of China
Taiwan, Singapore, USA, etc
I have 4
My manager said she's happy for me to take them before the 31st of May
I will take them on my probation....
Won't look good
But I have to take them by thew end of May or I will lose them!!!!!!
wtf
but I am on probation!!!!!!!!1
Why all in one go?!?!?
I want to do 2 day working weeks hahahahha
lmao if I was a complete moron? Isn't that what interviews are for?
I want to hoard my holiday days for when I need them, but I have a limited time to take them............
Annyoung SlyRatchet
Do you think I will pass my probation?
lmao
wtf you said you had £30
I only play serious esports games
lmfao
ANNYOUNG RORY
DAEBAK
can't leave early today because my manager's manager is still here :(
wtf my sister didn't send me a wedding invitation
The only way I found out I'm invited is that I saw my name on my parents' invitation
And my gf isn't invited
I need to get a copy of the guest list ASAP because if she invited my stepbrother's gf I'm going to be so pissed off and not going to turn up
I'll book a holiday to Korea or something instead
lmao fuck off
your a racist cunt
What do you think is best, Chinese, Korean or white?
having racial preferences doesn't make you racist omg
My gf does, and her opinion matters more than yours because she's Korean
hahahaha "trump"
lmao yes your such a nerd
hahahaha I could only dream of 21k
21k and no car? You must have a shitload of disposable income
My car is expensive as fuck
All these fucking repairs and speeding tickets
There's a grill at the office that I think wants the D
wtf is degreasing
wtf next year I will pay less tax but pay more NI
My salary goes up but my total deductions goes down wtf?!?!?
Why?
LMAO £400 is is still double the increase of my net
You mean gross?
Weird, my net has increased more than my gross
£205 net, £190 gross
IDK wtf you're talking about
Gross=before deductions, net=after deductions
Yeah to 11k
You studied Economics too?
I'm confused what you're talking about now
How much does your net go up by?
Good site http://www.listentotaxman.com/
Do you have a job?
Nice!!!!
Where do you work?
I have a permanent job too ^^
How do I find the values of my deductions? wtf even are deductions?
wow that sounds like it pays well
Oh yeah I know them
I am on student plan 1 and 7% pension deduction
I contribute 7%, my employer contributes 10%
Makes up for the low salary I guess
hahahaha my gym membership is deducted from my salary
So I don't pay tax on my £5 a month gym membership and personal trainer
It's fucking good value
£5 Spotify too
wtf is "the next"?
How much do you pay for Spotify?
LMAO
When did you graduate?
I am not a student either, but I still get £5 Spotify
wow how old are you?
Have you tried using your student email?
Mine still works
hahahaha rekt
I'm going to keep using mine until it stops working, then ask one of my Phillippines friends to pay for my Spotify for me
wtf is CIMA
£5 a month over 10 years will save you £600
£600 can buy you 6 pairs of great headphones
I might get YNAB
Is it good?
Does it work with my bank accounts?
I don't want to use it if it's too high maintenance
My finances are fairly simple
CBA to dl .qif files for every bank account every month omfg
That sounds like way too much work
cannabis should be legalised and taxed, just like sugar
Can I embed an email into MS word?
wow he sounds old as fuck
Why is that going to be awkward though?
lmao why?
My last job was so funny, my manager was like 21 and kept recruiting middle-aged people
23*
22*
22-23 something like that
Maybe 24
IDK
Annyoung rory
why the FUCK does my office still not have a bidet?
It's 2016 for fuck sake
It's the 21st century and I'm still shitting like I'm in the fucking nomadic era
Am I allowed to apply for other jobs whilst on my probation?
shrekt
ffs my work laptop doesn't shut down when I close the lid too
It gets hot as fuck in my bag with no ventilation
Why do we even need fans in office laptops nowadays? Isn't cooling a problem smartphones and tablets managed to solve without fans?
Just turn automatic updates off? I find they kill my framerate if I have them done automatically
IDK
Maybe that explains the short-periods of high ping and packet loss I sometimes get?
Or maybe it's just my shit powerline connection?
wow really?
That's craaaaazy
3G always amazes me, I just wish data caps weren't so limiting
Yeah £20+
3 and Giffgaff do unlimited data for £20 a month
Giffgaff is unlimited data, minutes and texts for £20 a month
omg how?!?!?!?
I'd seriously sign up to that
lmao
I just compared the unlimited data S7 contract to the standalone S7 + SIM and the standalone is still cheaper
Just goes to show that contract costs more even with high-end SIMS
Are there any cheap pay-as-you-go SIMS but with cheap data?
15GB TalkTalk data for £13 a month isn't bad
25GB for £15 a month
Yeah but rory was adamant that contract is cheaper
But I'm pretty sure he's wrong
It's not "free finance" as he says
Or the real mustache
I can grow facial hair because I am a man
wtf next Thursday we have a working lunch but no food is being provided and I'm not allowed to leave
So it's all the cons with none of the benefits
why not?
"Evening Meal should not exceed £20.00"
Guess I get a £20 kebab then
lmao yeah it's good
HOME TIME NOW BYE
BYE RORY
If my stepbrother's gf is invited, should I not go to my sister's wedding?
wtf

Crispin Blunt lmao hahahahahhaahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahhahashahjahahhjajhahjahashjahjhahahaha
No.
Will you be happy if cannabis becomes legal?
What's the best drug to take for depression?
I don't have a doctor
Why is the parliament building so empty when they're discussing drugs but other times they're all shouting at each other over stupid shit?
Why don't they just work normal office hours?
So when is it going to get decided whether to be legalised then?
lmao "the eyes have it, the eyes have it"
CRISPIN BLUNT LMFAO
Why do the eyes have it wtf
the eyes, mason, what do they mean?
Fucking Tories discriminating against blind people, it makes me fucking sick
Taking away their disability benefits just because the eyes have it wtf
omfg!!!! http://www.webupd8.org/2016/03/gnome-320-released-with-various.html
Because £750 goes into my monthly saver accounts each month and £350 goes to my mum, so not much is leftover for me
I want a house
wtf I just got £125 in mileage. I'm pretty sure I didn't drive that much
Lifetime ISA?
They won't be released for a while yet
lmfao £100k
Why would they crash that hard?
Houses will never be worthless
A £120k house isn't going to be worth £20k in 5 years time lmao
wtf is tht?
wow about time
congrats
I just checked my mileage form, and I put £61.38 in there.They fucked up and paid me £125.10 wtf
Why the fuck did my employer overpay me, and should I be worried?
Gnome Shell, after a few customisations, is srsly nice now
I was using it last night on a virtual desktop
Yeah I think I should make sure I budget for it, just in case
I'll enjoy the interest in the mean time
Yeah I think I'll do the same
Even though I do
A lot
hahahahhahah
That video you sent me last night looks srsly good
Do you think I can put a camera in my room and use my room as the background for my virtual desktop?
So I can look around my room with my VR headset on?
That would be so cool
It would be like I'm not even using VR!!!
Are you excited for Android Pay?
No TSB support, which is my current account :(
I use TSB current account because it's 5% interest up to £2k and has 5% cashback too
Yes they do!!!!!
I switch bank accounts all the time
I love the free money
I opened up a Tesco account just so I could switch it
Then I re-opened the Tesco account
I have a capacity of £3,000 ready in my Tesco account in case I get more money
But it's only 3% interest
I think later this year I'm going to have a problem where I have more money than I'm able to generate interest on
Because all these accounts only pay interest on the first 2-3k
Later this year my First Direct monthly saver will close leaving me with about £3,700 to allocate somewhere
It's going to be a right pain trying to find accounts to put it in
I might just spend it on a new gaming PC instead
I might actually go on holiday one day
Where shall I go? Seoul or Shanghai?
LMFAO
Your such an idiot srsly
Syria is in the middle of a really bad civil war right now
It's a shithole
It's the last place I'd want to go lmao
Why does Thunderbird only get my Hotmail emails once every 10 minutes, but my openmailbox emails come through instantly?
wtf do you mean
Yeah so Iota is telling people to go on holiday to Syria and obviously I'M the troll lmao
Why are you watching it?
Holy shit a plane is about to hit it
TWO PLANES
OMFG
holy shit that was a near-miss twice
Will desktop motherboards have USB C soon?
Z170 only?
Congrats!!!!!
Student overdrafts are good btw
Free overdraft you can generate interest on
No need to close it
Keeping it in case you need it too
Ah okay then
If you don't have any interest-free overdraft any more, then sure
I have over £5,000 in savings for emergencies
Also, my parents and grandparents
If I really need the money, my parents or grandparents will give it to me
My grandparents sometimes give me money even if I don't need it
lmao how?
srsly how the fuck can you get into so much debt?
How did you fuck up so badly that you needed to borrow so much?
what poor life choices?
I don't get it
lmao you spent thousands of pounds of other peoples' money on drugs?
That doesn't seem very sensible
£400 a month in interest!??!?!
holy shit that's crazy
That's £400 of your money wasted a month
Over the course of a year, you lose £4,800
Did it not occur to you that being in debt costs a lot of money?
Isn't that common knowledge?
Why not?
Yeah but you make sure you don't get in debt before you even get interest and fees
My bank reduced my student overdraft from £2,000 to £1,500 without telling me, and charged me a fee for being overdrawn, so I phoned them and told them to remove the fee
Saved myself £6 ^^
lmfao
If you plan ahead, you will never go into debt
Make sure you always have more money than you need
Did you really need to spend all that money on drugs, or could you have gotten by just fine if you spent a bit less?
£200 a month is still a decent amount to spend on your hobby
Yeah, just don't spend £2,000 a month on it
£200 a month is very sensible

lmao my manager just gave me shit for saving I saved hundreds of man-hours and told me I should use "person-hours" instead because she is a feminist
2016-03-24 12:42:23 +davehamill fuck x86 culture
It's causing male-genocide
Cis-shitlords are people too
2016-03-24 12:47:01 +davehamill lmfao
What's your favourite gender?
2016-03-24 12:51:28 +davehamill hahahahha Iota doesn't know
What is Mbps in megabytes?
2016-03-24 13:52:11 +davehamill MB/s
It looks like it peaks at 70 not 80?
2016-03-24 13:52:54 +davehamill lmao
2016-03-24 13:52:58 +davehamill 10MB/s isn't that fast
2016-03-24 13:53:05 +davehamill I download that fast and I probably don't even have fiber
2016-03-24 13:53:24 +davehamill I live in a shitty rural part of the country
omg you had 4mbps 10 years ago?!?!??
Wow that's nice
lmao no, I just had really shit internet
I think my Wi-Fi has actually been the bottleneck for a long time
I was downloading at 1MB/s and had lots of packet loss, then I upgraded to Powerline and got like 8MB/s and no packet loss
2016-03-24 14:13:46 +davehamill Wi-Fi is shit as fuck for torrenting and gaming
2016-03-24 14:13:52 +davehamill And any large downloads
2016-03-24 14:14:00 +davehamill Wi-Fi is basically just good for casual shit
2016-03-24 14:14:06 +davehamill Like Reddit
2016-03-24 14:15:40 +davehamill I really want some diet mountain dew
2016-03-24 14:16:42 +davehamill HOLY FUCK
2016-03-24 14:16:59 +davehamill You could download an Ubuntu ISO in like 4 seconds
2016-03-24 14:17:16 +davehamill Only faster than 92% surprises me
wow that's nice
But that's not 200MB/s lmao
I think your internet is about 3X as fast as mine
You said 25.5MB/s
Is it 200 or 25?
2016-03-24 14:20:47 +davehamill lmao rory you put me on server side ignore again?
2016-03-24 14:23:11 +davehamill fuck flash
2016-03-24 14:24:31 +davehamill I install it just for Twitch
2016-03-24 14:24:52 +davehamill Don't relaly need it for anything else
Why?
2016-03-24 14:53:20 +davehamill The "plastic film" is part of the packaging ffs
lmfao
yes
wtf is a driving risk assessment?
you mean a driving test?
Why did you need that?
haha I hadn't driven for 7 years before recently
2016-03-24 15:01:58 +davehamill Driving is easy, once you learn you never forget
2016-03-24 15:02:09 +davehamill Kinda like riding a bike
wtf
2016-03-24 15:02:55 +davehamill What is the best email client, Thunderbird or Evolution?
2016-03-24 15:03:08 +davehamill I like Evolution's UI more, but I like how Thunderbird supports RSS feeds
lmfao I hate big roundabouts too
Use Google Maps or Waze
They give you lane guidance
If you get into the right lane, just stay in it
Google Maps is great, but I recommend Waze if you want to avoid getting letters from the police
What vehicle do you drive?
Yeah I feel the same way about Waze
I prefer Google Maps, but the speed camera features are too good...
This is mine, but grey instead of red https://www.gumtree.com/p/citroen/citroen-c1-vtr-2011-36600miles-1-owner-from-new./1159155807

Real men drive cars instead of get trains which get delayed by assholes jumping in front of them
2016-03-24 15:22:17 +davehamill I need to get all my payslips so I can get my student loan overepayments back
I need to find my P60 too, must be in my room somewhere
omg my student loan will cancel itself when I turn something like 47-49
2016-03-24 15:48:51 +davehamill Then no more debt!!!!
2016-03-24 15:49:00 +davehamill Apart from a mortgage probably
2016-03-24 15:49:14 +davehamill Gonna be in debt for the next 25 years though lmao
2016-03-24 15:51:23 +davehamill omg 5 years from now I can probably still date 23 year olds
2016-03-24 15:51:43 +davehamill So even though I pretty much can't have a relationship for 5 years, the 23 year olds will be waiting for me!
Why would I want to date 23 year olds?
23 gives them enough time to mature
Without getting too old and saggy
Yeah man, 23 is a good age
2016-03-24 15:52:55 +davehamill Especially with Asian girls who don't really get immature and annoying
That's more of a white-girl trait
lmao you had an Asian gf?
Chinese?
lmfao
2016-03-24 16:42:41 +davehamill In September I'm going to be so fucking rich
2016-03-24 16:42:58 +davehamill My First Direct monthly saver will expire, giving me about £3,700 money
2016-03-24 16:43:18 +davehamill I'm going to build the most powerful gaming pc EVER
2016-03-24 16:43:25 +davehamill And play CS:GO at 600FPS
2016-03-24 16:43:26 +davehamill hahahahha]
Annyoung rory
MLG starts today omfg
In 5 hours
I've placed my bets :)
No foreigners allowed?
Bet on Fnatic in CS:GO, they're dominant as fuck
Fnatic is BY FAR the strongest team
They have been for over a year now
CS:GO is super easy to watch even if you have no game knowledge
You know how weapons work, right?
You know how guns and knives and grenades work?>
So it's easy to watch
You know what happens when the SAS shoot a terrorist with an assault rifle?
LoL is such a bad game though
That actually sounds really fun
I'd join you if I lived in Leeds
omg did you hear about the SJW shit in Overwatch?
wtf
wtf
Yeah the drama will be dead within a few days
Congrats m9
lmfao https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9bq_alk-sw
look at that windoze fag at 0:55
lmao yesterday I was watching MLG in the gym at work

Spotify limits the amount of songs I can store on my device to 3,333

There's no such thing
You could get high quality wired headphones for under £50
See http://www.head-fi.org/a/headphone-buying-guide
Can you get wireless adaptors for wired headphones?
A battery pack+bluetooth with aux jack?
I just told him that
<£50 wireless headphones lmao what a joke
He shouldn't, since I have more headphones than you
Look at the guide I sent you
You can't remove the cable, and they are well above £50
(NM) Koss PRODJ 100, $40-60. Solid build quality, coiled cable, and folds for portability. Natural, clean, sound. #1, #2, #3
lmfao
£200 gives you a shitload to work with
(VN) Audio Technica M50x, $130-$180.
wtf I just said that
£3,000 on a cable is a fucking waste
It's just a standard AUX cable IIRC
What headphones would you recommend if I want open back but with deep bass?
They have deep bass?
IDK the DT880 doesn't look like it has deep bass
I think the Philips Fidelo looks like it might have deeper
From reviews!!!!!!!1
Can you send me a pair to try please?
I don't want to spend £100+ just to try them
Yeah I'm going to wait a year for the X2 QC issues to go away
Who the fuck is Serotone?
What car do you drive?
lmfao
Sometimes I really wish my DT770 cable was a bit shorter
Yeah but I read that the 80Ohms version sounds better
A good amp makes all headphones sound better
What does "built-in hearing technology" mean?
Lmao someone took that photo as a joke
You mean it has a built-in amp?
lmfao
I doubt it's that extreme
That just looks retarded
I kinda want to buy Beats just to hear what they sound like. I've heard a lot about them
What do they cost actually?
lmao Apple Earbuds cost like $1
Holy shit they're selling £60 headphones for £300?
I don't get the last one
The joke is that everything is black?
So?
Old photo maybe
Have you seen Pitch Perfect 2? It's pretty much a feature-length advertisement for Beats
lmaoi
You should watch it
It's a film about music
And they're using Beats all the time
wtf why did your doctor say that?
Hollywood actors aren't very attractive IMO
Why?
You're creepy
Yes
Your anti-depressants must be working well then
I did some work
Struggling with my fucking spreadsheet
IDK how to show matches between two sets of data
I'm thinking of trying anti-depressants
But they might make me slower in-game?
What?
Yay I got my P60 telling me I earnt less than £15k this year
Now I can send it to the Student Loans Company and claim back hundreds of £
You can watch MLG
Major League Gaming
If I earnt above the threshold for some months for student loan repayments but still below the annual threshold, do I still need to make the repayments?
t is possible that you had a student loan deduction in a pay period where you earned over the monthly or weekly threshold, but over the whole year your income did not exceed £17,335. This might happen if you receive a bonus payment or work overtime.
In this situation you will be able to apply to us for a refund of the repayments you have made in that year. However, we will not make a refund unless you ask for one.
You may decide you do not want a refund, in which case you will pay off your loan more quickly and pay less interest on the outstanding balance.
I doubt I'll ever pay it off completely
I need that £100 back to live on
lmao the interest is going up faster than I'm paying it off
I'm not even paying off the interest
That's fine, you'll be thankful of it when you're 55
His £750 will be much more than £750 when HansProleman is 55
BoE sets interest rates, not inflation lmao
They set the interest rate to target inflation rate
Didn't you study economics or something?
Same
Congrats
Your parents must be so proud
My mum always told me I'll never be able to hold my own job
As if it's so fucking difficult
A lot of people get made redundant
Being redundant is pretty much getting fired
I want to go to Shanghai
And Seoul
And Taiwan
So many cute gilrs omg
wtf
Poo time!
Your take-home pay would go up under any government
wow that's a lot of money
Aren't you at work?
wtf why is Spotify using so much mobile data? I set my playlists to be offline!
Stupid Google Maps uses lots of data too even though I downloaded England
Why do I have so many apps using my mobile data omg
Don't they know how precious it is?!?!?
ffs
I just turned on "Limit mobile data usage"
That should stop some of these stupid apps
Hopefully it won't restrict the stuff I need too much
Give me the Graze boxes pls
I want them but I am too poor :(
 omg no give to me
You subscribed?
How much does it cost?
lmao netflix is such a rip-off
Stremio is way better, and it's free
Do you watch The Big Bang Theory or The IT Crowd?
But it's quite funny?
Do you watch The Big Bang Theory?
lmfao why?
The program is so fucking funny
Sheldon Cooper is hilarious
Okay sure, I'm commending a 8.4/10 IMDB rating program, and I'm a troll for it

What is an oddity?
lmfao why?
Gilmore Girls?
The HTC 10 is rumoured to have capacitive buttons which is controversial
Do you like capacitive buttons? I think they're a great feature
I hate touchscreen buttons....
They're good
I prefer AKG K702s for open headphones in that price bracket though
http://www.amazon.co.uk/AKG-K702-Open-Back-Reference-Headphones/dp/B001RCD2DW/
4.8/5 instead of 4.6
They're also the best gaming headphones if you do any of that
The Sennheisers you linked are open
What exactly are you looking for in headphones?
Closed back, neutral, and removable cable? Go with the Audio Technical M50s like rory and I suggested earlier
You linked them
Go with these http://www.amazon.co.uk/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50X-Monitor-Professional-Headphones/dp/B00HVLUR86/
My phone has a better DAC than yours
I might get the HTC M10 if it has a great DAC, camera, capacitive buttons, and batery life
I'd be pretty happy with my M9 if the fucking camera was any good
20 megapixels but still looks like shit lmao
GYM TIME
What?
$1.5m independent Dota 2 and CS:GO tournaments announced https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4ck0rc/alisports_alibaba_announces_15m_csgo_15m_dota2/
What's the biggest prize pool of independent LoL tournaments? $100k?
MLG is starting in 8 mins!!!!
hmmmm it's not in the guide
AKG is a good brand though
One of the good ones, along with Beyer and Audio Technica
They produce some excellent consumer cans
Why is it optimistic?
I might start working from home soon
I have way better IT equipment at home
Mechanical keyboard
I am on a standard flexibility contract
Yeah I guess so
holy shit
"nervous breakdown" wtf?
I installed Microsoft Office 2010 on Ubuntu last night
wtf why?
Weed is week shit
Compared to cafeine
If you did 20g of caffeine you'd die
Yes
You're a meanie!
Caffeine is the most popular psychoactive drug in the world
"kickban rory
!kickban rory
I drink energy drinks so I know exactly how much caffeine I take
lmfao
If that was true, then why don't I have LEDs in all my gear, and why do I have audiophile headphones?
I might buy a few of these http://www.amazon.co.uk/Management-Organiser-Flexible-Baltic-Organizer-Black/dp/B013F9NS5Q
One for my K702+modmic might be helpful
My modmic is fucking annoying
Headphone cables piss me off so much
Tab Tree
Firefox is better than Chrome IMO
IE was never the superior browser
IE didn't even have tabbed browsing until like 4 years after Firefox
Chrome just has the biggest market share
Google has big branding with their websites and Android products
Firefox's market share is amazing considering Mozilla is such a small company
Firefox has BY FAR the largest market share:marketing ratio
Firefox is massive despite very little marketing
Iceweasel=unbranded firefox
What happened to Iceweasel?
What happeened between Debian and Mozilla?
Holy shit http://www.pcworld.com/article/3036509/linux/iceweasel-will-be-renamed-firefox-as-relations-between-debian-and-mozilla-thaw.html
wtf is Sunbird and Seamonkey?
Why did Mozilla demand Debian rename Firefox wtf?
It seems like Mozilla was being restrictive with their licensing?
And Debian wanted to be free?
And now Mozilla have surrendered to Debian?
btw what do you prefer out of Thunderbird and Evolution?
Or Outlook
Why is Outlook "the real deal"?
So you use Outlook on Linux?
lmfao gmail?
The web site?
lmao
I use Thunderbird with openmailbox
Why does Thunderbird get my openmailbox emails instantly but my hotmail emails only come through once every 10 minutes?
I think they're both IMAP
wtf is Monster Cables?
24 why?
I bet Currys only has shit
Beats and Bose rubbish
I never went to those shops
Online shopping is so much better for electronics
How is Protonmail any more secure than openmailbox?
Isn't that the same as openmailbox?
Nothing about openmailbox on that page
I think so
Bus timetables
My car ftw
omg I just got told off for changing the administrator password and not saving it to the plaintext file on the network drive so others can see it
saving passwords in plaintext just feels so wrong...
I just made a complaint to the data protection people
The networked drives are supposed to be secure though I think, since we have a lot of private documents on there
But it just seems so bad to store passwords in plaintext for some reason....
Am I being paranoid or not?
I've always been told "DONT store passwords in plaintext files"
I mean I guess there's worse things they can get to on the drives if they're compromised
Yeah or maybe I actually want to do the job properly and not just redirect blame?
Just had a team day
Got a lot of free food from HR
HR girls flirting with me again
Now I'm going for a poo
Gonna watch MLG on the toilet
420 pooscopes
I play loud music in my office
Why can't you?
lmfao why?
Maybe just wear headphones secretly?
Invisible IEMs
Or cover your ears with a hat or hair?
Nobody will know.

And pubs and bars
A lot of small shops like florists
And buses only accept cash too
I think most pubs do now, but a few still don't

No buses here will accept card, it's cash only

Job creation isn't necessarily a good thing
Terrorism creates jobs too
And the mafia
Tobacco companies create jobs
NSA creates jobs
But I think you'll agree that none of these companies are forces for good
They do more harm to the economy than good
LMAO no not really
They are bad
bad bad bad
Externalities.
It is relevant
Just because it's not simple to put a monetary value on something doesn't mean it's worthless
Economic metrics are more than just revenue and tax and GDP
What about HDI?
You can measure economic performance in a lot of ways
GDP is a flawed concept
It's not a good measurement of development
It's used by politicians to boast how great they are
If you want to measure a country's development, you need to consider life expectancy and health, literacy, PPP, inequality, internet speed, etc
Not tobacco industry revenues!!!!!!
The tobacco industry causes a lot of pollution too
It also makes a lot of people uncomfortable when they are smoking passively and smelling all that smelly shit
Because some asshole next to them at the bus station decided to light up a cigarette
Are you going to ESL Pro League at The O2 Arena next month?

What do you think of this monitor? http://www.amazon.co.uk/Acer-Predator-screen-Curved-Monitor/dp/B014F9QHVC
I want that monitor....
What do you think about that monitor?
IDK whether to save up and buy a 200hz 21:9 monitor or a VR headset
Yeah but it's still nice to have your opinion
Yeah I'm not sure about curved either
But if you go ultrawide without curved then viewing angles could become a problem?
Yeah the monitor I'm looking at seems to come down in price by about £20 every week
Well 200hz is pretty fucking amazing
21:9 is amazing for gaming and films too
Your FoV would be great
You have a much better awareness around you
Like the difference between gaming in 4:3 and 16:9
I hate how Street Fighter is locked to 60FPS in a time when you can buy 200hz monitors
Yay the person next to me has gone home for the day

obviously we should make the minimum wage 10p an hour to stop migrants coming

Enough to know she didn't go to Starladder

FInding a box large enough is a pain in the fucking ass
I got a massive crisp box from the supermarket but it's slightly too small
I can put bubble wrap over the main surfaces, but not the edges of the screen
It's just about wide enough to fit the monitor, but not lots of bubble-wrap
I can't wait to actually get a 144hz monitor though omg
Would be amazing
I've been stuck on 60hz for decades now
I might even upgrade to a 200hz monitor later this year/next year
Yeah I assumed that too
Then I found out it was frameskipping above 60hz
So now I need to return it
I found out when I OCed it to 189hz
You don't need audiophile headphones either
But they're nicer
CNo
I want to44
When I OCed it to 189hz it was frameskpping
I reduced it to 144hz and still frameskipping
Was always broken
Just never realised
It's a common problem with this model
Lots of people have been complaining
It's got lower input lag and a lower response time than my other 60hz monitor
So it felt better
But it didn't feel like a huge difference
Barely noticeable
Couldn't figure out why until I tested for frameskipping
wtf is Ocado deliver
Ocado is like Amazon?
wtf
Like Tesco?
HansProleman your weird
Can they give me bubble wrap by tomorrow/
Have you seen Goen Girl?
Post Office is probably closed by the time I leave work
I need tape and bubble wrap!!!!!
Maybe
Need tape too
ffs I wish I didn't have to package this fucking thing
It's a pain in the fucking ass omfg
My gf is 30 lmao
I'm taking her to meet my father on the 15th
I told her not to talk about bible stuff
Because my dad will think she's fucking weird
yeah it's weird wtf
I might dump my gf just because I don't like to wake up early on Sundays
Did you see The Walking Dead season final?
The ending was so fucking bad
The writers of the show are such asses srsly
lmao I've just been listening to someone say "hello, can you hear me, hello" on the phone for the past 10 minutes
lmao she's still doing it
IT is helping her now
omg the person next to me never goes to the toilet
I like it when she works from home because then I don't have to worry about how long it takes me to take a dump
What do you prefer out of sugar and aspartame?
YES She's gone off into town, so I can go do a poo now ^^
REDDIT AND TOILET TIME NOW FUCK YEAH
back
How long was I?
I also went to the stationery cupboard for a little bit
Yeah probably about 20 mins usually
Have to walk to the other side of the office to use the nice toilet
lmfao
It was a particularly nasty poo though
I wish beef jerkey was cheaper
Have you noticed any muscle growth since you've started working out?
https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/4dbqom/htc_teasing_hi_res_audio_not_all_music_is_created/
Maybe I will upgrade my M9 to the M10
My HTC One M9 has a fantastic DAC
And HTC is fixing the camera and moving towards stock Android which I like too :)
And I can put my 200GB SD card into it :)
M50?
That was fast
I always opt for free delivery
If you can wait 30 years for good headphones, what's another 5 days?
lmfao
Do those headphones come with three different cables?
Hahahahhaaha
You pay twice as much as me
wtf
What are you talking about?
Wanna be friends on Spotify?
Add me I'm 420sam
Add me please
It's a bit of a waste of high-end headphones if you're not even going to listen to kpop on them
yes
It's the highest production value of any music in the world
Who has been sexually abusing you?
I fucking hate nice people
They have no social awareness at all ffs. When they try to be nice to me I tell them to fuck off
Serves them right for having no social skills
oh wow Dota is in VR now
Puff, pathethic. The BRAND NEW Legue of Legends screensaver just rapes this sitthy 3d thing without a doubt.

lmao 7% of Iceland's population protested yesterday and now the PM has resigned
omg WhatsApp got OWS end to end open source encryption by default last night
https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000618/end-to-end-encryption
omg I found a feature in Wechat last night that lets me search for females in my area
lmao you always could
Annyung
https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000618/end-to-end-encryption
Wtf is "the ping"?
lmfao
We should make his tax evasion illegal
I looked for that message but none of my contacts have updated WhatsApp yet
I didn't like WhatsApp before because I thought it was a spying platform
But it seems pretty good now
I just deleted Telegram
Is that a viable business model?
omg I still can't find any of my contacts running the latest version of WhatsApp wtf
Does nobody enable autoupdates any more?!?!??
And if WhatsApp still isn't making a profit after 5 years? What happens then?
I would suggest the f2p model to sell skins and cosmetics, but WhatsApp has a nice minimalist client and it would be a shame to ruin it.
What companies actually use WhatsApp to communicate with their clients anyway lmao
I thought Facebook was a really evil company dedicated on spying on everyone, now I'm not so sure
Anyway, I deleted Facebook last night
I don't need to be spied on any more now that WhatsApp will encrypt my messages
When I first bought my smartphone I installed EVERY messaging app, now I only have 5
WhatsApp, Wechat, Skype, Steam and Signal
And I might uninstall Signal because nobody will ever fucking use it
Chinese version of WhatsApp
What use is Facebook?
I can use WhatsApp for messaging
Reddit for memes
And I never get invited to events anyway
Yes
Facebook memes are just reposts from Reddit's front page the day before
wtf is FYAD
I used to post on Digg and think reddit was terrible
They fucked up and Reddit took over
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg#Issues_relating_to_former_Digg_website
Disgruntled users declared a "quit Digg day" on August 30, 2010, and used Digg's own auto-submit feature to fill the front page with content from Reddit.[48][49][50] Reddit also temporarily added the Digg shovel to their logo to welcome fleeing Digg users.[51]
Alexis Ohanian, founder of rival site Reddit, said in an open letter to Rose:
â€¦ this new version of digg reeks of VC meddling. It's cobbling together features from more popular sites and departing from the core of digg, which was to "give the power back to the people."[47]
Why is there no desktop Windows or Linux client for WhatsApp?
I don't get it, what's the limitation preventing a desktop client?
But I can also use it for phone calls and file transfer?
How the fuck does phone # auth work?
Can't people just spoof my number to hack into my whatsapp?
I DONT KNOW OMFG
yay Barney is bringing me a 144hz monitor today!
Can't wait to get back from work later
Barney is currently making delivery number 8, you are delivery number 89.
Barney is approximately 4 hours 45 minutes away from you.
You can watch Barney's progress on our map.
Barney
Your location
He's only a mile away
Yes
wtf is hxc
An unofficial derivative called WhatsAppTime has been developed, which is a standard Win32 application for PCs and supports notifications through the Windows notification area.[53]
Fuck web apps
I hate leaving a web browser with 500 tabs open all the time
I need to close that shit because it slows down my gaming
It's so bad to just stick fucking everything in a web browser
Yeah it's the disk io and CPU cycles
It reduces my framerate by 1-10%
Yeah sometimes
Trying to get it up to 999
Better input
I'm going to wait for 2nd gen. Reviews of 1st gen say it's way too laggy for serious gaming
And low resolution
Laggy and low resolution
I mean casual CS:GO
You don't need to turn your head
You can still move oyur mouse
It's just a virtual screen
But people have said it's too laggy
I'm more interested in the virtual desktop mode because it works for everything
And I want a 50 foot virtual display
I want to watch films on a display bigger than my parents will ever own
Yeah I guess so, as long as the latency and resolution are good
You need a 6700K + Corsair H100
I want a VR Chinese gf
wtf?
srsly?
Are you joking?
ffs I have to take 4 holidays by the end of May
I don't know when to take them
I might take a Wednesday and go to Thorpe Park
I can get £20 tickets through work
yay
omfg
I'm so jealous omg
I wish I could afford to fly to Vietnam for 2 weeks
I haven't been on holiday for fucking years
My friend invited me to Amsterdam
I really need to wait until September before spending any money though....
Why is it?
My First Direct Monthly Saver Account closes in September, so I'll have a shitload of disposable income, but right now I'm poor as fuck
Do I want culture?
Yeah I might buy a 21:9 200hz monitor in September
I'm going to be so rich
Do both!
£3,700 can go a long way
I'm going to be so fucking rich in September
I'm not gonna spend it all, because I'm saving for a house or something
I don't mind hostels
They're just cheap hotels
lmao yeah
Fucking idiots
I'd rather save the money so I can enjoy the conscious parts of my trip more
As long as the room is comfortable and safe, that's all that matters
Which it probably will be because of regulation
omg I just did a really loud and smelly fart
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35959554
I fucking love Dominos
I wish I could eat Dominos every day
My doctor and personal trainer maybe?
What is to stop WhatsApp from stealing my private key?
" even if encryption keys
from a userâ€™s device are ever physically compromised, they cannot be
used to go back in time to decrypt previously transmitted messages."
niceeeeeeeeee
That's why I don't do pills
You don't know what's in them, and they can srsly fuck you up
Only regulated ones
I wonder if the USA will try to shut down WhatsApp
It's open source
It's the Signal Protocol by OWS
So it's a really good implementation
Why is Google Drive the only backup site that WhatsApp supports wtf
I want to backup to my Mega
It's more scure
GYM TIME
wow a $3.5m CS:GO league was just announced
LoL's prize money is really being left in the dust compared to Dota 2 and CS:GO
Shit, I drove past a police car this morning
I don't think I was doing more than 68 though
I'm probably okauy
Waze didn't warn me though....
wtf sometimes people send an email to me asking me to do something, but its so small that they probably could have done it themself in the time it took them to write the email.
I got my 144hz monitor replaced yesterday because it was frame-skipping above 60hz so wasn't real 144hz. Holy shit the difference is incredible
I can notice the difference instantly just by moving my mouse around the screen omg it's amazing
It's so much better than 60hz srsly
I might even OC it up to like 190hz
ANNYUNG RORY
ANYEOUNG RORY
rory:
Where the fuck has rory been all week omfg
lmao
ffs I want to go for a poo but I am worried everyone is going to time me
The whole team is in today
I would use a VPN, but I don't want to ruin my ping for gaming ffs
But I like to go on Reddit on the toilet
Why do we still have music albums instead of just singles in 2016?
I thought albums were a limitation of physical media?
So you'd buy an album record or CD or tape?
Nowadays, why don't we just have singles? We can download multiple singles easier than buying multiple CDs
Very rarely do I find an album where I like every single song
I usually just pick and choose songs from multiple albums
Not if they're part of a 1,000 track playlist
Sure, if you're a filthy casual
Real men listen to kpop
I wish someone would take over the maintenance of my kpop playlist for me
It's such a pain maintaining it on Spotify
Just put a shirt on
Or don't answer the call
Say you were on the toilet or something
I never answer the phone
Kinda
It's what I'm paid to do I guess
wtf fucking tag your links as NSFW
If my manager caught me looking at guns at work I'd be in so much trouble
Depends which channel your talking about m9
Stremio Android version is in alpha now
"ask where to buy drugs."
Read the rules maybe?
wtf
What?
Police are allowed to say they're police
Buy using Panama company
wtf my mum told me that there's no point asking for my student loan overepayments back because I have to pay back the money eventually anyway
With that kind of logic, I might as well write them a cheque for £5,000 tonight
Yeah but the interest isn't much
I can do more with my money if I don't repay it
It's 0.9% APR lmao
I'm getting 6% from my savings account
Think it's about £100
Need the money...
I need the money so I can keep putting £750 into monthly savers
"need" is a subjective term m9
You don't need weed but I bet you'd disagree with that
Are you familiar with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs?
There's a tier-list
Basically, you only really need water, shelter and food
But if you want a higher quality of life then you need higher-tier needs
Like entertainment and security and relationships
What's funny?
I'm being serious ffs
I am not a comedian!!!!!!!!!1
Right so the huge budget necessary for funding of Trident is so controversial, but somehow some random dude makes one in his bedroom?!?!?
I paid below the annual threshold last year because I took all my holiday in one big go
Yeah it's better to pay back as little as possible because it's only 1% interest on your loan, which you can easily beat with any decent savings account
And if you haven't paid it all back within 25 years, it gets written off
Also, if you're going to borrow any money or get a mortgage, the interest on that will be way higher than your student loan which is like 1%
I think paying it back might be good if you have too much savings to claim benefits, or if you want to take out another student loan
But that's the only reasons I can think of
lmao I just had a thought. If you got a student loan at 90, you'd probably never pay it back hahahhaha
You'd die before you paid it back hahahahha
Damn really?
wtf no they can't
That would be illegal
Nobody agreed to that
Source?
Okay, firstly that's the 2012 plan
The new one, not the one most graduates have
You're talking about an entirely different type of student loan
That one in the article is a different contract
Well technically the amount you repay changes every year
If the threshold never changed, then inflation would cause you to pay more and more each year
It changes nominally
.I
Anyeoung rory
?
lmao the PM just admitted to tax dodging
And he even said it was a "private matter"
Same, it's hilarious how much of a hippocrit our PM is
And he's not even going to resign
That's your opinion
His entire upbringing was financed by tax dodging
And the laws are designed by the people who will circumvent them; they design them with loopholes already ready to use
It's corruption though
He's not compliant to the high standards people uphold his position to
If he was the PM of Iceland he would have resigned by now
The UK is just so used to it
Whether they're sold in 2016 or 2010 doesn't make that much difference
I really need to get a VPN before making these anti-government comments
GHCQ will log it, then it will be used against me in 10 years
The information is being gathered now ready for when the police state is fully set up
The only reason we don't have a dictatorship yet is because they're still in the process of gathering dirt on everyone
We're getting there
Give it another 10-20 years
damn man ur even more paranoid than me
Damn, PIA don't do a 24 month deal any more :(
Private Internet Access
wtf are flat packs
VPN
wtf why do 90% of people date someone within 1 year age of them?
Do they only look for people within 1 year of them?
So they exclude 99% of others?
My gf is in her 30s
She's fitter than most grills in their 20s though
lmao my colleague just told me off for not deleting my emails and "costing the business money"
Then I researched that it costs $0.03 per 13,333 emails not deleted
She just spent 10 minutes trying to find an email she deleted
Pennies are an insignificant amount to save
I think she thought that hard drives cost a fuckload more than they actually do
I'm pretty sure we could store everyone's emails at my company on just one hard drive
Why 50mb? It's not 1999 any more
It's Exchange server yeah
It's 2016 and we have 8TB hard drives
Why would they limit you to 50mb?
What?
The DPD drive is naked?!?!?
And fat?
The delivery driver is wearing a gown wtf?
Oh looks @ you
Okay
Sorry, the @ confused me
Surely they're used to it?
"Storing every e-mail you have ever sent is both wasteful of computer resources and will
slow down your email program."
Surely Outlook is coded not to slow down if you store lots of emails?
And surely cost per GB is cheap enough nowadays?
Is there any actual evidence of Outlook slowing down, or is it just a 'common sense' thing?
yeah that's my attitude
No reason to delete them, and might cause a problem if I ever want to search my emails
I wish I was working from home so I could work using my 189hz monitor
It's so fucking responsive
IDK might do. Animations are a lot more fluid
It's more comfortable on the eyes too
And it gives you more mouse precision and more responsive control in general
More responsive input
Have you ever used a 189hz monitor?
It may be difficult for you to understand if you're so used to 60hz
I might upgrade to a 200hz monitor later this year
That Acer Z35 ultrawide 200hz monitor looks sick
In September my First Direct monthly saver will close, giving me £3,700
Might be <£500 by September
Archer?
Spend some, save the rest
That's a DP limitation actually
You can't have 1000hz and 4k
Display Port
You're limited on bandwidth
They can't increase resolution and stay within bandwidth constraints without lowering refresh rate or getting Display Port 2.0
High refresh rates have been very niche until recently
Arguably still very niche
That's your opinion
Oh yay our IT policy is being reviewed this month, maybe they'll stop advising us to delete all our emails
I'm gonna skip the first gen
Yeah I'm with HansProleman
Definitely interested
It looks awesome
I have waited like 5 years for it, what's 1 year more?
I was being sarcastic omfg
Isn't Pascal and Polaris due to be released in a couple of months?
What's your GPU? I have a GTX970
You should get a 1080TI
I prefer to spend more on the CPU because I play CS:GO
I'm gonna wait to see what the system requirements are for Source 2 and Overwatch before doing any upgrades
ATM my 4690K is the bottleneck

I LOVE DOMINOS
I go to the gym over lunch most days
office gym ftw
Weed smokers are "losers" according to the Daily Mail
I have obesity
Eat more?
AmerieHartree commended for teaching
Nope, and the PM won't resign either
It's a private matter
I love how suddenly he's so concerned with privacy
After being so anti-privacy for so long
ffs tag it NSFW omg
where the fuck is rory
It's a private matter
David Cameron is an ass
How much do you pay for Spotify Premium?
hahahhaha yeah
Why don't you get a student discount? Are you not a student?!?!?
£5/mo could pay for my gym subscription
For you maybe
lmao what's your salary then?
holy shit
I only earn £14,760
What's that pre-deductions?
Oh right nvm then
wtf
My gross is 19k and my net is <£15k
How so?
What's weird about that?!?!?!?
Yeah
How much pension do you get?
Actually, now the tax year is changed, I get exactly £15k net
lmao only 4%?!?!??!
I get 17%
7% myself, 10% from my employer
Well kinda
If my salary sucks then it doesn't really matter
How old are you?
Okay, you still have 30 years to save for your retirement
Good luck m9
HOME TIME BYE
How did you sell your DT770s? I want to sell mine
I want to sell them and get Custom One Pros instead
Yes
So what's the answer to my question?
Want to buy my DT770s?
I'm thinking of buying this, and just switching out the headphones instead of unplugging and replugging and dealing with long cables every time I want to change https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00BJ17WKK
But I need all my headphones to have detachable 3.5mm cables for it to work
If my Modmic falls off my K702s again I'm going to buy the V-Moda BoomPro mic instead.
I'm going to use my DT770s for the conference call this morning instead of the shitty headset they gave me
lmao
I get 1% and I couldn't be happier
I have a permanent job!!!!
I'm pretty happy I just have a job ATM
Fuck unemployment
Can't afford to pay rent
Almost ended up homeless!
I read about it but didn't watch the video
It's good because it will make the rockets re-usable which will bring down the cost of space travel?
Yes?
Why?
add me on Spotify, my username is 420sam
Not all of it is hifi
Sometimes it can be really lowfi
You might notice Spotify has some big limitations the more you use it
It's missing a lot of important features
Like removing duplicates from playlists, and downloading more than 3,333 songs
There's no EQ either, which a lot of people want
A lot of songs aren't on Spotify either
wtf is crossfeed?
wtf is DSP framework?
If you want to mitigate listening fatigue, then why not buy AKG K702?
Not really
Similar to other mid-end headphones
I recommend Fiio E10K
Only £60
I heard that the M50s are uncomfortable on-ears and uncomfortable with glasses
And you have to mod them so they work with any aux cable
I would mod it to work with V-Moda Boom Pro
Want to buy my DT770s?
M50s with or without glasses? I need them to be comfortable with glasses!!!
Exactly
I would leave my DT770s at work, but I would be worried about them being stolen
By the cleaners
We all know cleaners are audiophile thieves
Oh yeah, and a lock!
Nice
My drawers are full of energy drinks
And gym kit
Fuck no, I will get them smellier and smellier
I have over £5,000 now
I have so much money omfg
I could buy a 35" Acer Z35 21:9 200hz monitor
I could buy a second car
lmao
I get the least sex though :(
My parents don't let me have girls round
Yeah but it stands out to stop you from reading it
I use high priority all the time
It makes people respond faster
wtf I just noticed that my laptop only has one VGA output
How am I supposed to connect more than one display to it?!??!?
Only VGA
No DVi, no HDMI no DP
Actually, not sure on HDMI
I'll check again
Nope, just one VGA wtf
VGA wtf that's fucking ancient technology
Why is my laptop VGA
A single VGA port wtf
It's an i3-3120M
So it's fairly modern
I connect two displays by using the laptop dock
I don't have one at home :(
I guess I could just work using my gaming PC?
Or do most of the work on it
IDK
Would it work?
How do I get cisco vpn + citrix?
VPN + citrix I think
I think we use RDP?
Yeah?
RDP via citrix yeah I think so
Can't I just VPN in and use citrix natively?
RDP sucks ass
I spend more than that on PC gaming in a month
wow why?
I thought I had a lot at 550
Does Citrix Receiver work on Linux?
Yep https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-receiver/linux/receiver-for-linux-latest.html
Why do you have 1,100 games?
That's ridiculous
Get a life
I can't because trolling is strictly forbidden in our company policy.
How many do you have?
I have ~550
Same
Most of my games were free giveaways
Samsung Galaxy S4 only £50 on classified
What?
Is the reason why my dad is so homophobic because he is from Portsmouth?

No, as long as it does what I need it to do.
My HTC One M9 has a really good DAC, but I will upgrade to the M10 if the DAC stays the same/improves but the camera is significantly better
I'd prefer to save money on phone upgrades and upgrade my PC instead or save up for a house
I wish steroids didn't have any dangerous side-effects
Hey can you buy me a 21:9 200hz monitor please?
Me too :(
All my money is locked up in monthly saver accounts :(
I mean I technically could buy it, but then I wouldn't have £700 earning 6% any more
Why are you skint wtf you earn like 3X what I do
A day at Thorpe Park
Oh yeah debt...
Debt is bad mkay
I might ask my grandparents if I can borrow some money to help me until September
No, I'm just lazy
s/rory/hansproleman/
damn that sucks
I just want free muscle growth
I don't cycle
Cycling is too dangerous
Not bicycling?
hahahhaa I already have boobies
Not sure if my boobies are fat boobies or muscle boobies
How does tensing check them?
No I mean I tense my boobies but that doesn't tell me if they're fat or muscle?
Okay so my boobies are at least partially muscle then?
hahahahha same
I am kinda chubby
I really need to get round to curing my obesity sometime
lmao
I like meat
I eat so many fucking animals omfg
Sometimes I eat a whole chicken
Not if you eat a shitload of it
Really?
It's kinda a lot of meat to eat in one go
Don't you think?
wtf are macros
why are they called macros?
What are micros then
I think you know a lot more about nutrition than me
wtf are minerals
Calcium and iron are good!!!!
lmao
The manager drove his car into the restaurant in a similar incident
Why do I have long purple marks below my chest?
.I
I told you I am not a troll because we have a strict anti-trolling policy at my job!!!!!
omfg
I love flexing in the mirror right after a workout; makes me look ripped as fuck.
hahahahhaha
Do you give it to her?
What if only one of you is down?
My gf wouldn't accept that
Don't think so
My gf always seems to want it
Like every day
My gf only works part time
I think only bible stuff
IDK what else she does with herself
She isn't interested in butt stuff if it's her own butt
Except the shit
And the bleeding
I know you can get rid of the poo and bleeding, but it requires setup
Can we change the conversation to be less NSFW?

Excel is hrd
I'd say Dota is probably the hardest
That game has a shitload of depth no other games do
I'd be happy if I could not live with my parents and still save a shitload of money every month
Oh shit I'm terrified of that last part
Actually all three
What?
You can't escape from real life!
lmao
I am good
Very good
Want me to coach you?
What esports do you play?
Sure, I play L4D2 and CS:GO
I used to be really fucking good at L4D2
Then I got bored of it because Valve don't give a fuck about that game
Versus is fun, especially with the competitive mod or L4D1, but the game gets repetitive fast in its current state
In L4D2 the survivors are too OP
Fucking laser sight AK and automatic shotgun
Yeah
Fucking 30 round autosniper
Nope
Laser AK/autosniper are ridiculously OP
There aren't hats because Valve abandoned L4D
Quake Live is dying
L4D is dying
Get into CS:GO or Overwatch or Dota
Blizzard's FPS
Kinda like TF2, but with more classes
It's been really well received by pros and casuals and everyone
There aren't any big problems with it AFAIK, and the open beta will be out in less than a month so we can all try it out for ourselves
full price retail game
Half-Life 2 is a good one
Have you played Crysis?
I've heard Bioshock is good, though I've never played it.
I think I started up one of them but the love FoV turned me off within 10 minutes.
s/love/low/
Maybe, but I CBA
Have you played Far Cry?
Have you played CS:GO's co-op missions and single player?
The co-op missions are pretty good
But a bit short
ps3 controller wtf
Console gaming is for peasanta

wtf my mum told me she is taking my sister to the hospital today because she thinks she might have leukemia
DAE think our government is a fucking joke because it's just rich twats yelling at each other?
I think about 26
Yeah that would be good
I don't know what would happen to my nephew if my sister died
She rarely has contact with his father, and she is engaged to her new partner but not married yet
I am his godfather
But my brother is too, and he's much more well-off than me
yay I am due a refund of >£100 on my student loan
And last night I spent 10 minutes switching my Tesco account to Halifax to get £100
I keep creating empty Tesco accounts to get the switching bonus lmao
I wonder if at some point Tesco will stop letting me open them
I've opened like 4 accounts with them so far
I need as much money as I can get, since my first monthly saver doesn't close until September, and I have my MoT+tax+insurance in July
Also my speeding ticket....
I might ask my grandparents to lend/give me some money
Just need to supplement my income as much as possible until September!!!!!
Then maybe buy a 200hz Acer Z35 21:9 monitor hahahhahaa
Are you gonna buy VR?
Imagine doing spreadsheets on an IMAX sized screen omfg
The only thing putting me off VR atm is the low refresh rates and low resolution
I don't think I have switched to Halifax yet
I switched to TSB and FD
But not Halifax
I think they rejected me last time
Maybe because I was unemployed
After the shitshow that was Shanghai major, it looks like Alibaba will be taking over Dota in China now.
Alibaba is a fucking huge company, kinda like how LoL has Tencent
Chinese megaconglomerates
I have a new strategy for dealing with ads on my phone. Instead of using Adguard which will eat up my battery and prevent me from using a VPN, I will just use unofficial/paid apps and an adblocker on Firefox
Ez no ads without rooting or using shitty adblockers ^^
Probably saving a lot of battery life
fuck ads srsly
wtf I told me gf not to talk about bible stuff when she meets my father and she started flaming me
s/me/my/
s/my/me/
fuck
IDK how to fix that
I have to take my holiday too
When I worked for the agency, I would just take the holiday pay
I took like £1,000 in holiday pay one week and paid off a shitload of my student loan
Gonna play video games on Wednesdays
And go to Thorpe Park on the 27th
I'll probably have to walk the dog too because my mum will ask me to
I would appreciate a donation if anyone wants to give me one
I promise I won't spend it on drugs
Or if you want, I will promise I will
Sure
If I was a homeless person, I wish people would give me money
But most people won't because they'll think I'll just spend it on drugs or alcohol
I love how my mum has no hobbies and gets wasted every evening but still calls me a loser for playing video games
Typical Daily Mail reader
She won't play it, she thinks video games are for fat losers
She always tells me she knows only one person who plays video games, and that's her colleague who is fat
So she thinks all people who play video games are fat
It's pretty funny
It's unhealthy
Not sure which is most unhealthy out of obesity and alcoholism though
Well it's not as black and white as  that
Alcoholism and obesity increase your risk of different illnesses
You can't just say one thing is more unhealthy than another
Depends on severity and genetics and other risk factors
But both alcoholism and obesity are pretty damn unhealthy
Also, alcoholism can cause obesity
Smoking is bad for you too
And driving
Your trolling game is weak today m9
This is you https://lolcow.farm/b/thumb/1424817916927.png
wtf nothing about that is NSFW
yay I just sent my letter to the Student Loans Company asking for £102 of my money back
I will use that money to MoT and tax and insure my car for another year
I need to get as much money as possible before September
lmfao how?
I pay back like £12 a month, probably less than it increases in interest
I might not ever paid it back entirely
It's such a large amount
If I owned a house I would literally never have to worry about becoming homeless
What happens if you can't afford to pay council tax?
Do you then get sued and forced to sell your house?
And become homeless?
is there any way to be 100% certain I will never become homeless?
If my gf had even half as much money as me, my life would be so easy
The problem is that I have to pay for 90% of everything
I don't mind paying for 75%, but 90% is a bit of a burden
Have to pay for my petrol to visit her, for her train tickets to visit me, for the food we eat, etc
She also wants me to pay her rent and buy her a house
I can't, because that would be cheating
It's funny watching my gf try to get into my encrypted phone
She's like the FBI
Whining at Apple (me) to unlock the phone for her
To read my messages I guess
My gf is 30
Because I have more money than her
She only works part-time in a supermarket
My gf wants an office job but her English is not very good
Also, her visa is expiring next year
Where is it?
Near Brighton?
Why?
Yes.
Yes.
But the milk is really nice there?
Bigoted wtf why?
What does that mean?
They hate foreigners?
Do they hate my Korean gf?
Do they hate mainlanders?
lmao why?
Everyone is a little bit racist
Like my mum judges me for playing video games and living with my parents?
You live in the wrong country then lmao
Play video games maybe?
UK?
The UK is the most racist country in western europe
lmao
hahhaa
I should go there with my gf
Jeremy Clarkson is from Yorkshire isn't he?
hahaha would be funny if I lived in Chipping Norton and bumped into him at the supermarket every week
I bet he's a dick IRL
Buy a car maybe?
My car has made my life so much more convenient
wtf that sucks
If I lived in London, I wouldn't have a car
What sort of sick bastard steals bike wheels?
You should track them down and bludgeon them
Emotional support wtf?
Why?
Do you need any emotional support m9?
I drive my car because I don't want to die
hahahahaha your gf is a nurse?
Do you ever roleplay as patient and nurse?
wtf
Does she ever tie you to the bed?
Do speed cameras ever flash at you when you're on your bicycle?
You can easily go 35 in a 30 or 24 in a 20
Especially if it's downhill
I'd laugh if the police pulled you over for speeding on your bicycle
How are cyclists even supposed to know how fast theyr'e going?
Would that defence hold up in a court of law?
I'm still waiting to hear from the police how much they're going to fine me
I have a speedometer on my car and my Waze
I think my Waze is more accurate though
It's higher than my Speedometer, so it's probably more accurate
my car speedometer is undertweaked I think
It said I was going 50 when the speed camera said I was only going 40
Good thing what is over?
wat
It would be good if it's accurate
ATM I go over the speedometer intentionally because I know it's undertweaked
It's illegal for a speedomeeter to be overtweaked by more than 10% IIRC
So manufacturers usually undertweak it
That's what a traffic policeman told me
Are you going to buy the HTC M10?
I think you'd like it because it will have an amazing DAC inside it
http://venturebeat.com/2016/04/12/htc-10-unveiled-5-2-inch-qhd-display-12-ultrapixel-camera-with-laser-autofocus/
The company also notes that the HTC 10 was subjected to over 168 hours of extreme temperature tests, ranging from -20°C (-4°F) to 60°C (140°F), plus over 10,000 drop, bend, scratch, and corrosion tests
The HTC 10â€™s camera is also designed to launch â€œin as little as 0.6 seconds.â€ RAW format support is also a go.
thanks m9
omg 8 days until 420!!!!!!
Yeah that
Yes
The amp is really powerful too!!!!
omg lucky
Can you ask for one for me too?
I want to try it before buying
Please
Hmmmm maybe
 I don't have a contract with EE
I'm thinking of upgrading to a higher data tariff
ATM I only have 500MB of data
Sure, thanks m9
SIM only is good
SIM only is usually cheaper
Why is it the "best" network?
SORRY, WE COULDN'T FIND THAT PAGE
Try using one of the links below ...
Not sure I really need speed
I mainly just use Waze and WhatsApp
And a bit of Reddit
lmao "zero"
What if you're in the middle of fucking nowhere?
Or on a mountain?
Why is the 16GB SIM cheaper than the 8GB?
lmao
What's that called, 'distraction pricing' or something
16GB for £16 isn't bad
Yeah same
Decoy pricing
only £12 with cash back wtf
How do I get the cash back?
Can I make and receive phone calls and receive texts on the 25GB data only SIM?
lmao
I don't think I need more than 2GB really
WhatsApp and Waze and Reddit use such little data
I use Wi-Fi at work and home
Congrats
Did you know that standing is just as unhealthy as sitting?
wtf
hahaha I never do any cooking or cleaning
I should probably vacuum my room some time though
It's dusty as fuck
Won't my gf just do all that?
haha did anyone see that MP who made a speech in parliament about how people aren't angry about tax avoidance, they just hate rich people?
No, she works part-time at a supermarket
Time for some cardio
She was studying English when I met her
gym time now bye
You sound like a fucking stalker m9
No
I feel the same way about Guild Wars 2
No thanks, not going to click on that
In 16 years time I could be dating a girl the same age as I currently am.
I said "could" not "would" omg
I can't predict the fucking future
Stop saying a Strawman Argument omg
Such an asshole move srsly
Anything can happen in 16 years, it's a really fucking long time
Jesus Christ dude, do you not have any social skills?
Some things are inappropriate in certain situations omfg
If I knew the language I'd definitely consider it
Yeah I know some
It's too time-consuming to learn a language
Korean alphabet is actually very simple
Hangul
It's basically just a bunch of sounds
You can use Hangul with English
It's not related to the language
https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiv1f-BsonMAhXmApoKHYAoAjMQtwIIHDAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTE4eplsFSms&usg=AFQjCNHuFWAS8mu0ubyiUSs25Vj4tXY6Jw&sig2=C6WN0SaAUBLoywzib0qs-g&bvm=bv.119028448,d.bGs
sry fucked up URL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE4eplsFSms
fuck google and its fucked up URLs
Yeah I kinda want to learn Mandarin
Chinese alphabet is fucking horrible though
hahahahha same ;)
hahahahhaa Dota is the best for learning russian
http://imgur.com/gallery/oPElr97
way better
90% of the Dota playerbase is Russian
It's craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazy popular there
Like LoL is in Korea
wow
I have a Chinese friend who is fluent in Spanish, English and Chinese
Like most Europeans then?
Most young people from Western Europe know 2 languages nowadays
haha they will unless you vote UKIP!
Congrats, you just saved your job from being stolen!
Rekt.
wow MLG Columbus peaked at over 1.6M viewers
What?
Do you srsly think there were 1.6M viewbots that Valve and MLG weren't able to account for?
wtf are you talking about
It amazes me how many of our customers don't have the internet
IDK how they can live without it
wtf is hibiscrub
Fuck, I only have £420 to last me until September
Gonna get £102 from student loans company and £100 from Halifax though
And gonna get some money from my salary too
I pretty much only have £100 a month to live off after rent, savings and fuel :(
750
90k in 10 years
Not including interest
Well I might not be able to maintain it for much longer
My gf wants me to spend a lot of money on her
If I dump my gf I could keep it up np
Anyeoung rory
I want to get my hands on Overwatch so I can see what part of my PC I need to upgrade next
Yeah but I want to get 300FPS
I'll probably lower the graphics to minimum
Where'd you find this?
Damn son, where'd you find this?
You play CS:GO?
How many hours do you have/what rank are you?
I'm pretty good as CS:GO
Do you have a 188hz monitor?
lmao
Maybe if you had a decent monitor you wouldn't suck so much
I got to SMFC on 60hz only playing occasionally
I'm probably the best at competitive video games out of anyone in this channel
I can coach you!
Would you ever buy used headphones on ebay? I'm thinking of buying them to save money
wtf
So you're content being shit then?
wtf like what?
lmao I saw a number plate on a car yesterday that said "Big dick, down to fuck"
60fps is shit because that's 17ms of input lag
You can reduce that to just 3ms if you run 300fps
haha why?
What did you study?
I have lots of Amazon alerts
Is it not dodgy to order headphones second-hand off ebay though?
wtf
that's creepy
Don't say that
Yes and you're a pleb unless you do
I can confirm that rory's headphone budget and suggestion is good
I'm going to just buy headphones with removeable cables from now on I think
And get a V-Moda Boom Pro and have like 3 audiophile headsets ^^
One cable, three headphones ^^
Will be soooooooo cool
I shouldn't have bought my DT770 and Modmic.....
Waste of money
I might end up leaving my DT770 at the office as my office pair though
They're great office headphones
Sure
I will leave my DT770s at my desk if I get a Custom One Pro for home
I don't need the removeable cable for my office desk anyway
I hate how many cables I have at home desk omg
And bus people
In a meeting, talk later
Would be better in VR
£25
I think I'll try using ebay
never used it before, should be fun
It's selling for £40 brand new, so I think it should sell for £25
How much do ebay charge?
Ah didn't know that
It's like Steam market then
wow ebay must make a killing off that?
even though they get 10% of the total?
I just asked my manager to buy me this http://www.amazon.co.uk/Duronic-Double-Monitor-Bracket-Warranty/dp/B00AV70AEI
Using four stacks of A4 paper atm
I will settle for £20+postage. The adhesive is used so it probably won't stick to your headphones unless you get some adhesive. I don't recommend using superglue unless you're certain you never want to remove the clasp.
Yeah sure
Not sure what it is, I'll look it up later
Need to get to the gym before it's too late!!!!
GYM TIME NOW BYE
I don't think I have a Paypal account, could you just do a bank transfer?
lmao your such a druggie
Can you do a bank transfer instead? Is easier
Hmmm never used bitcoin before
What do you use bitcoin for?
Paying for your VPN and illegal drugs?
Do Dominoes accept bitcoin?
damn that sucks
Can bitcoin be used for tax evasion?
I'm not sure if I can post it until Monday. I am at work today and tomorrow, then I'm with my gf over the weekend. I took the day off on Monday so I can go to the Post Office.
wow you have over £300 in bitcoin?
Oh right
How much did the value of Bitcoin change over the last financial year?
I'm on a boat
Oh wow it doubled in the past year
I should have invested
£130 in August to £311 in January holy shit
I bought some items on the Steam Market for 9p a year ago which are worth £8.60 now
https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Operation%20Bravo%20Case
wtf why?
KPIs for the outsourcing contract
Have you seen the HTC 10 yet?
The phone looks really fucking nice
I'm always thinking about Dota too
Want to buy my DT770s?
omg you tell me to PM you and you put me on server-side ignore
I can't post it until Monday anyway, because the fucking post office in my town has the same opening hours as my working hours
Hey good news
My brother told me about a "jiffy bag"
So I can just buy one of those from the supermarket.
Oh I can buy the label online
Can I put it in the post box too?
oh lmao they mail the label...
Okay, my grandfather will post it for me tomorrow, I just need your address now.
?
 Are you still ignoring my PMs?
This is cool https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/4eky2g/i_made_a_nintendo_ds_sized_pocket_computer/
Anyeoung rory
Anyeoung lota
lota you should get AKG K702s, they're amazing headphones
Best gaming headphones
stop ignoring me omg
How much mg of caffeine did you consume?
I've ODed on caffeine before and it's not nice
I thought I was going to die
I just PMed you with my bank details m9
That's quite a bit for a work night m9
I pre-ordered Overwatch last night
Gonna get 2 beta keys sent to me soon
Why do I keep getting this wtf 
â“˜ [716] rory, is in +g mode (server-side ignore).
Did you know that BBC studios use DT770?
They're made in Germany too
Yes, Germany has much higher quality manufacturing than China
My Shure SE215 was made in China
I think my AKG K702s were made in Austria or something
DT770s are pretty old now
Did you know that the DT770 was first produced in the 80s?
HD600 is such a scam. AKG K702s and Philips Fidelo X2s are just as good despite being cheaper
My AKG K702s sell for as little as £130 now, which makes them a bargain
And the Fidelo X2s are really cheap now too
Maybe they were important when K702 and X2 prices were higher
wtf
What doesthat even mean?
lmfao
HD800s cost like £600
I'm pretty happy with £100-£200 headphones
I'd rather have a few different Hi-Fi headphones than go all-out on the HD600
HD800*
My next purchases will be the Beyer Custom One Pro, the Audio Technica M50x, and the Philips Fidelo X2
Swap what for what?
I'm up for swapping headphones
I want to swap my DT770 for something else
I think I'm going to end up either leaving my DT770s in the office, or selling/swapping them
I want to cut down the number of cables I have at home
They're shit compared to Valve
Yes
I get 17% of my salary towards my pension, that's not bad I guess
And an office gym
thanks m9
We even have a fridge in the office!
wtf somehow I just took a screenshot of my lockscreen
creepy
I don't, because I have a gf
I get laid even when I don't want it
Yeah sure, I probably won't be buying the X2s for a while though.
Too much of an unnecessary luxury right now. I need to focus on my savings and upgrading my PC for Overwatch.
lmao don't play with  vsync
I never play with vsync or AA
I always play with lowest graphics to maximise my FPS
Tearing is barely even noticebale at 500FPS
And 188hz
Shadow are one of the few things you should srsly consider turning up
They give you a competitive advantage
You can't see fuzzy blob shadows around corners
And Overwatch
wtf
Don't be a filthy casual pls
I wreck scrubs
Only fucking casuals play for fun
Na, I don't have the time or commitment to become professional
Also, I like to play a few different games rather than just one
I play Dota, CS, Street Fighter, and Overwatch
Street Fighter is a bit consolised though :(
IDK why they can't just release a good PC version
Wanna do a phone swap?
I'll swap my HTC One M9 for your HTC 10 once you've bought it
omg I just spent £5.20 on the sandwich van
only got two things
Did you know that you can build a gaming PC as powerful as a console for £150?
I did it on pcpartpicker
http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/dHRDrH
It's on the CPU
It's better than any GPU under £40
IDK
Would my 4690K+GTX970 decade h265?
So many people have 4690K+GTX970, it's a ridiculously popular combination
I wish I spent a bit more on my CPU, it's bottlenecking my framerate
You should get a 1080TI
Probably like £500
£150 for gfx cards lmao
I spent that much just on a pair of headphones
Why are you so cheap?
Wasn't the 8800gt the GTX970 of its time?
Your attitude is why you are still gold nova
It's the rank above silver
NA silver 1 I guess
NA is so bad
SEA is pretty bad too
I'd hate to play CS:GO on a laptop
60hz, tiny screen, low framerate, high input lag, shitty connection
Dota would work better
I thought you sold your DT770s?
How do I sell mine?
you said you sold your headphones
lmfao "brown and cream"
makes me think of faeces and semen
They look like DT990s
I mean the headband does
Listen to this track with good headphones https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ
wtf
omg my gf is going to meet my father today
I hope she doesn't talk about bible stuff
Would be so embarassing
I'll probably dump her if she does
I told her not to
lmao I know you're joking but I've actually been thinking about how cool that would be
imagine spreadsheets on a 300" IMAX sized 21:9 screen
The resolution will suck though
And the refresh rate sucks
I prefer to do spreadsheets in 188hz
I want free VR too
I am poor
I bet it sucks
I tried Samsung's headset and it was shit
Vive looks better
I'll buy it when it's a decent monitor-replacement
Until then I'll just buy a better monitor
Those are high specs!
4GB lmao srsly?
your a spoiled brat
VMs are cool
no laptop will ever have a screen large enough for me
I would prefer a VR headset over a laptop screen
15.4" is fucking tiny
Why not just get rid of the screen and carry a VR headset instead?
Similar weight, but MUCH more screen realestate
use a virtual screen for collab
Just make a 24" virtual monitor
You know you can make virtual displays inside VR, right?
http://store.steampowered.com/app/382110/
Then you can collab on that?
And you can have your own 300" IMAX-sized display next to it
They are now
But what about in the future?
What if we have 1000hz 32k VR headsets?
in a couple of years
Would you buy one then?
lmao rory does standup
Like Michael Macentire
oh wow only 6.66% that's only 5.66% more than me
No, I don't watch standup
I wish I got a bonus at all
Can I apply?
Riot games has a really toxic company culture m9
Riot Game*
Gonna go home and mail you a microphone now
Speak to you on Tuesday
Weekend with my gf now
bye
yay training days tomorrow and Wednesday
I posted your mic and ordered my new one. I'm loving my K702s without the modmic cable right now. The modmic really got in the way of how frequently I would change my headphones at my desk for different purposes.
I'm effectively changing 3 cables for just one! It'll make cable management wayyyyyyyyyy easier
Removable cables ftw
Do you know anyone who does a DT770 removable cable modding service?
I don't have the balls to do the mod myself
I want to add a removable cable to my DT770s, not buy a new pair
oooooooooooooooooooo
Why do some headphones have dual entry?
wtf why is it miniXLR?
If it's XLR then I have to buy one of these http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mini-3-Pin-XLR-Female-TA3-to-3-5mm-Jack-Socket-Adapter-TA3F-Tiny-Headphones-AKG-/182052233104
Most use aux
M50s, Sennheiser, Philips Fidelo X2, etc
Yeah okay good idea
Why do your HD600s have dual entry?
Why are you talking about "high-end" when we're discussing DT770 then?
What is the point of dual entry?
Cheaper?
I don't think dual entry is much of an issue, I just don't understand the point of it
Are you sure Philips X2 Fidelio isn't high-end?
Is your HD600 "high-end"?
What do you think of these headphones? http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyerdynamic-Custom-One-Plus-Headphone/dp/B00PK2LJ4E
You can adjust the bass on them
Four bass settings
If I had more money I would buy all the headphones on my wishlist
I think my next pair will be the Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro
Then the M50X
Then Philips X2 Fidelio
Then get O2 DAC or Schitt
Weird how your bot outputs a different song than Spotify
.l
.I
who the fuck is gonzo
Are you still using E17 AMPDAC?
same
Why not O2+ODAC?
I can't justify spending more than a few hundred pounds a year on audio.....
My E10K is pretty good too
I think I'll keep my E10K for a while yet
I need to upgrade my CPU really badly
It's fucking ridiculous how my 4690K is bottlenecking my framerate in CS:GO
I'll buy a new case and CPU cooler to get a decent OC out of it
Or hopefully the game will be ported to Source 2 and Vulkan and bring down the CPU load
Buy me this please http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/17/11448434/dji-drone-m600-ronin-mx-stabilizer-price-release
Buy me this please http://www.privateislandsonline.com/islands/moucho-de-alhandra-island
What network rules?
There are rules?
lol I was jk I don't expect you to buy me a private island
CBA to read all that
I'm not at work today
Took the day off
I fucking love the Hydraulic Press Channel
I wonder if they'll ever put a living thing on the press
Can you press water?
Does it turn into ice?
And if you press ice, does it turn into water?
Can you press diamonds?
Can you press Sennheiser HD800?
Two weeks until Overwatch beta omfg!!!!!!!!!
http://us.battle.net/overwatch/en/blog/20100169
wtf "we will not be issuing tournament licenses for large-scale events with prize pools over $10k"
You need a tournament license to hold an esports tournament now?
wtf my mum said she put a court summons on my bed a couple of days ago but I can't find it
I can't
I never even saw it
IDK
I looked under my bed
Can't find it
IDK how she even knew it was a court summons without opening it
I can't show up to court if I don't even know about it omg
Does it actually say on the envelope that it's a court summons?
I never got any letters
She said she didn't open it
Do Halifax bank and the police have the same address?
Damn
I haven't been in contact with the court though
Haven't had anything
hahahahahha
How do you know so much about the courts system?
lmao why?
What have you done?
I do?
Is it because of that bank robbery you commited 5 years ago?
My throneroom would have lots of cute Asian girls
And good back support
The back is the most important part of a chair, because proper back support prevents you from getting chronic back pain later in life
Damn that sucks
Do you have a chirofractor?
No
My next purchase should be a proper desk tbh
My new chair. I had to take the arms off so it fits under the desk..... http://www.amazon.co.uk/Swivel-executive-ergonomic-Computer-adjustable-armchair/dp/B00ENZ1T4Y
Sure
I've already done it, but I'll help you out
Hmmmm do you mean the story missions or just defending the bombsites?
Yeah
Okay good, CBA to do the bombsite defence shit again
I don't like it
Not enough space for my mousepad
A monitor shelf is pointless too when you could just buy monitor arms
I do like how it is less wide in the middle though
My perfect desk is pretty much just a massive plain surface
Like this http://www.amazon.co.uk/1800mm-Cantilever-Straight-Desk-Length/dp/B00IS26EFC
I like desks which curve inwards at the middle like yours so you can sit closer to the desk though
You can do the same with display arms
No, you clamp to your desk
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Duronic-Double-Monitor-Bracket-Warranty/dp/B00AV70AEI
Sure, they sell shitloads of variants to cover whatever you need
Yep!
Swivels, moves in and out, rotates, etc
What?
hahahaaha £120
wtf
Look at the pricer history,it never went above £59
s/pricer/price/
It's been £30 since 1051 days ago
Fluctuating between £25 and £30 mostly
I would get arms for my displays, but I wanna get an ultrawide at some point
I use the plugin which tells me the info on the amazon pages
https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/
I saw a setup which was like £50k
I'd love a curved desk with a huge level surface area
But I don't have the space
I don't have the money
Do you like mITX rigs?
But you don't mind a little additional setup, right?
wtf why?
Building it yourself is always better!!!!!!!!!!
lmfao
You get warranties on the individual parts anyway!!!!!!
I would NEVER let someone else build my PC
I choose every part
I like this http://imgur.com/jSkWIJs

Looks a little small though
Even parts they dont' stock?!?!?
I want this case https://rationalbananas.wordpress.com/2015/09/26/specifications/
I like to fit massive amounts of performance into tiny cases
CBA with water cooled. AIO kits are much easier
the maintenance isn't worth it
AIO is nice and easy, just dust it out every couple of months

For an independant tournament especially. That isn't a Valve-sponsored event.
"This seems like a pretty clear win for the x2"
wow the queen is 90 on Thursday
Well that Reddit post you linked me is interesting
So why should I pay extra for the Sennheiser headphone if it's not as good as the Fidelio X2?
My AKG K702s sound really nice
On Thursday I'm going to connect my new mic to them
lmfao https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4fb6t8/uk_home_secretary_theresa_may_tried_to_alter_drug/
Theresa May wants to spy on you and make you a criminal for doing drugs!
I think my AKG K702s sound a lot better than my DT770s actually
Less fatigueing too
They're great when my home is quiet
But rubbish for the office or when dogs are barking and stuff ofc
Just great sound quality and comfort
The highs and mids are crystal clear
And the bass is very tight without distortion
They are THE BEST headphones for gaming too; the soundstage is unbeatablew
Hmmmmm I've read that the Custom One Pros don't sound as good as my DT770s
So I think I'll go ahead with the cable mod and get the  Philips X2 instead
If my K702s can sound this amazing, I bet the X2s sound like audiogasm
Oh cool
Can I try them on pls?
Have you compared them to the DT770s?
Which do you like the most?
Which has the most bass?>
Which do you like the most?!?!??!
wtf I read the opposite because of the bass ports
Okay thanks man, I think I won't buy the COPs when I still have my DT770s
re the sound leaking
omg I have until April 30th before my annual health plan cashback resets. What should I get done?
LMAO HOMEOPATHY IS COVERED
You can't replace with velour pads?
I think I might spend £30 to get a removeable cable added to my DT770
+P&P
I don't have the balls
It's a tricky mod for the DT770s
Have you ever used the Philips X2 Fidelio? Those might be my next pair
They look incredible
Did you inhale it from a balloon?
What other headphones do you have?
What do you think of the Fidelio X2?
What headphones are you interested in?
Holy shit, I found an actual headphones store near me http://www.richersounds.com/stores/bath
Why can my work laptop connect to my Outlook and Lync, but my home PC can't?
I use the same login info
http://i.imgur.com/fQUMvfU.jpg
Do you have Fidelo X2?
What headphones do you have?
ooooooooo nice
Those look like fun headphones, like the Fidelo X2s!!!!
I've been looking at the DT990s but I think I might get the Fidelo X2s instead
Do you like Asians?
I'm saving up for my Fidelo X2s, then I'll do a swap with rory's HD600s for a few weeks
But IDK if I can afford them before September :(
And then I'll need at least a few weeks to break them in ofc
I'd like to try your DT990s too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rtV5esQT6I
I bet that song sounds amazing on your DT990s
I love Asians
Anyeoung rory
I love my AKG K702s
They sound way better than my DT770s
I want Fidelo X2s now
I think they're endgame for me
The perfect amouint of high quality sound and bass
Why?
Why does Lync and Outlook work on my work laptop but not my personal PC?
Can't tell if youi're being sarcastic
I thought that the secret to good-sounding audio was to just add more bass
lmao
I'm going to build my new headset on Thursday!
Yeah saw it earlier
So why are you browsing /r/dota2?
what the fuck
What would your boss say if he finds out?
wtf
You're creepy
Do you like Asians?

"Hi Sam, 
             It is not something we offer - we spent quite a long time  getting the technique right so we could get the holes just the right  size and in the right place to fit the minXLR sockts. Even though it  should be quite straight forward we are just too busy to take the time  to experiment getting the fitment right on a different size socket. It  would probably be a fun DIY thing for you to do your self thought and  there lots of guide
Jason"
hahahahahahaha https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-nUigOMRwc
last night I was using my phone's mic to play CS
My work laptop has two VGA ports what the fuck
VGA is so last millenium
My trainer yesterday and the day before uses Fedora
How long do I need to leave my drink in the fridge before it is cool?
Too long and I'll be too thirsty
And in a meeting
I love taking my 1 litre energy drinks to meetings
And not showering in the morning
Wow really? Thanks m9!
I'm more interested in passing my probation than getting a promotion right now
Is that possible?
omg 16.04 LTS is out today!!!!!
I don't want to shower twice a day ffs
My new mic has arrived, but my XLR adaptor hasn't yet....
Hopefully it will today
Wanna skype each other with our new mics later?
I've read reviews saying that the Boompro and Modmic have similar sound quality
wtf
Could do 2v2 to balance out skill discrepency
No but I have Bittorrent
No sorry I don't have it
I played it a lot when I was younger
What happens when you run out of wood on the map?
Oh yeah the market
Doesn't wood get increasingly expensive though?
I am probably quite good at AoE because I play so much Dota
Yeah more than yoiu
wtf how do you have micro skills?
There's turn rates in AoE btw
Yeah so like Dota
Dota has more in common with an RTS than what you call "MOBA"
I might do
It's been on my wishlist for a while
It's the HD remake, right?
I think I was going to buy it a couple of years ago but it used GFWL instead of Steam....
But does it work on Linux?
Wanna have a LAN party?
I am going to build a new headset tonight
Just waiting for my miniXLR to 3.5mm adapter to arrive
I'm not going to click on that
I am building the ultimate gaming headset
AKG K702s and V-moda Boompro
Way better than your DT770s+Modmic
K702s are the BEST gaming headphones
But they suck with Boompro and Modmic
They suck with the modmic because they have a curved mesh, so the modmic won't stick on properly
And they suck with the Boompro because it is XLR instead of 3.5mm AUX
But I bought an XLR to 3.5mm adapter!
So now I can build the ultimate gaming headset!!!!!!!!!1
wtf?
Way better than your DT770s+Modmic
What?
I wish I could get Lync working on my home PC so I don't need to use my work laptop
ATM I'm using my work laptop just for receiving Lync calls
Have you got 16.04 LTS yet?
Xenial Xerus
I have it on a VM but I can't switch from Windoze until Overwatch is working.......
I have to use Windoze just for Overwatch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes ofc
omg I've heard the word "bespoke" about 1000 times this week but IDK wtf it means
wat
Is my custom-build gaming PC bespoke?
Is my Firefox bespoke?
What about my custom-build headset?
What about my car?
Mine has a spoiler
hahahaha
It gets me a lot of vag though
lmfao
When I read your sentence I was thinking about sleep and film/TV spoilers
I don't have the same dirty mind as you
Like if I said John Snow comes back to life, that would be a spoiler
I can neither confirm nor deny that
wtf you were running a PC on less than 4GB RAM in 2016?
4GB is the absolute minimum you want nowadays
For most people I recommend 16GB because RAM is so cheap now
You can get 16GB for £50 now
Or even £36 of just one stick
wtf why is this so cheap? https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kingston-1333MHz-Memory-Module-Thermal/dp/B00CDGOHUS?ie=UTF8&tag=pcp0f-21
lmao http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-virtual-guns-counterstrike-gambling/
haha whiney
I'm happy just to have a roof over my head, electricity, and an internet connection
And good internet
I like gyms
And a goodnight kiss
I take really long showers when I'm not paying for the water
Yes
But when I am out somewhere
I would take long showers at work, but I only have an hour :(
I could have a really long shower after work if I wanted
Can you fit two people in them?
What?
wtf
My gf likes to bath/shower with me
If I had more money, I would upgrade my PC, buy HTC 10, and buy Philips Fidelio X2
Do you know where I can get my DT770s modded for removeable cable?
That website you linked me told me they can only do XLR, which is not what I need
"pretty easily"
Sure, I'll just go buy a dremel and a soldering iron
lmao so I have to go all the way to Leeds or Bristol?
This? http://www.swindon-makerspace.org/
Actually, I don't think I need a dremel according to that guide
The hole is already big enough
Yeah a soldering iron
And a glue gun?
Need some glue
lmao my manager told me she won't buy me any display arms because they're too expensive and it'll set a president that other people may ask for them
Yeah I've been thinking about buying them myself anyway
But I'll probably get told to stop using them because using my own equipment is against IT policy
And I'll have to go back to using 4 reams of paper to prop my monitors up instead
Happy Ubuntu release day
Ubuntu 16.04 is an LTS
Maybe that will sway you
Even if you don't use Ubuntu, you should value the competition it brings to desktop Linux
Yeah I like Debian stable too
Why Redhat? Because they are commercial like SUSE?
Do you ever use Excel on Linux?
Do you ever use an EQ?
I just use the bass boost on my E10K
I find that any attempt to do any EQing myself just ruins other frequencies
And makes it sound worse
Should I ask my colleagues if I can borrow their shitty earphones and sources to see how bad low quality audio is in comparison to mine?
Like the way I do it?
What's the difference between digital EQ and amp EQ then?
IDK man I like the bass boost on my E10K
It makes the bass nicer without ruining the other frequencies at all
Most EQs I use usually ruin other frequencies when I turn the bass up
If you could make a specific frequency better without ruining other frequencies, would you?
Because that's what my E10K's bass boost does
Doesn't your Fiio AMPDAC have a bass switch too?
Mine how no screen either
lmao
How do you check the settings then?
Just get a HTC 10, then you don't need an AMPDAC
Cya l8er m9
HTC phones are srsly good sources
Yeah but you're not gonna take it out the house with you?
Take the reviews word for it
Or headfi forum
Yeah but you want a good portable one too
I'm gonna get an odac or schitt stack too eventually
I'd rather carry just a phone than an external AMPDAC
god portable ampdacs are so inconvenient
Extra space, extra weight, extra batteries, more cables, etc
wow that's cheap
GYM TIME NOW BYE
wtf
Do you have a gf?
FUCK my XLR to 3.5mm adapter hasn't arrived
Can't build my headset until it cums
It's the most crucial component omg
Am I a dick for walking away from my desk when someone is coming around collecting money for diabetes or something?
Also, IDK what I wrote in Joanna's birthday card earlier, was something like "happy birthday love from sam xxxx"
Might be a bit innapropriate
....
Can't tell if you're trolling....
Usually when people are sarcastic on Reddit they end their sentence with /s
Sarcasm doesn't translate well onto the internet idiots omg
Am I going to get into trouble for what I wrote?
It's on the card
With everyones' messages
ffs I was rushed to write it down before the birthday girl came back
If I lose my job because of this I'm going to be so pissed
Thanks, that is a relief
But where the fuck is my XLR adapter?
It was supposed to arrive either yesterday or today
And it hasn't!!!!!
I ordered it a week ago
And it's still not here!!!!!!
Where the fuck is it?!?!?!?
omfg
I hope my adapter arrives today
Can't use my mic without it....
Anyeoung chingu rory

wtf you're having surgery?!?!?
It's a real shame that the website you linked me aren't able to add a 3.5mm jack for me
They said it was because they are too busy to try something new at the moment. Maybe I should ask them again in a month?
It's a lot of effort and scary to try it myself....
My DT770s are really nice closed cans, so selling them and buying something else isn't ideal
DT770s sound better than M50s from what I've read
Although M50s make great portable headphones because they rotate and fold up nicely
I like how with the M50s you can rotate the cups to press against your chest so they're really comfy to wear around your neck
Whereas the DT770s are really uncomfy to wear around your neck, which makes them very bad portable headphones
Sometimes when getting off the train you want to wear them around your neck so you can hear where you're going
Or if you need to speak to the checkout lady
Or the bus driver
etc
Yay my XLR adapter has arrived? I can't wait to take it home tonight and build my new ultimate gaming headset!!!!!!
s/arrived?/arrived!/
fuck

I don't think I'll upgrade my Fiio E10K for a long long time
It's just not worth the money
maybe in 5+ years or if my E10K ever dies I'll get an ODAC or Schitt
Nice
I want Philips Fidelio X2
And I want DT770s with removable cable
Does anyone know any headphone modding services?
I just tried https://www.fixmyheadphones.co.uk/contact

You just don't understand his genuis
I'm definitely not. Almost anything is safer than alcohol, so it's not really anything to brag about. Cannabis isn't safer than kpop.
How addictive is cannabis exactly?
I know it's really fucking dangerous to smoke and drive
haha so it's less addictive than kpop and dota then?
ffs I saved the spreadsheet with one of the filters applied again. I know I'm going to get undeserved criticism for that soon
ffs I keep forgetting the names of the people I work with
Yeah I can easily lookup peoples' names
I forgot the name of someone a metre away that I've worked with for months and went off to another site together for two days this week

I discovered the sticky note program in Windoze and now I have covered my screen in sticky notes
I should go to the gym
Need to exercise to stay healthy
I'm thinking about getting a Saturday job
Just for a few months to boost my income
I wish my mum would have given me the £1,000 she said she would when I bought my car
Or not charge me £350 a month when I'm not using any of her water or food
My gf wants to move in with me later this year, but I'm not sure if the cost would be worth it
I get really cheap rent atm, so I can save most of my income
Should I get a younger, richer and less religious gf?

OMG
I just found out about credit cards
You can borrow thousands of ££££ and not have to pay it back for 2 years!!!!
wow
fuck sake there's lots of noise
When I plug the splitter into my E10K and motherboard
Headphones into E10K and mic into motherboard and lots of noise!
Just ordered this http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/SNI-1-3-5-3-5mm-Noise-Interference-Bulk-Filter-Ground-Loop-Isolator-Radio-Amp-/141938705019?hash=item210c34c27b:g:v18AAOSwxp9W86Bp
hopefully that'll sort it
I bought the wrong cable it seems
Needed a noise-filtering cable, not a regular aux cable
Lmao I've bought so many parts to build this headset now
E10k, XLR to 3.5mm adapter, Boompro mic, cable splitter, aux extension cable, and noise filter cable
Have you ever had a ground loop noise problem with your audio equipment?
Holy shit fixmyheadphones.co.uk will do it for me for £69.95
That's craaaaaaazy
That's almost enough to buy a new pair of headphones lmao
I just solved my money problem
I reduced my First Direct monthly saver amount from £300 to £25
Now I can buy lots of headphones
What blanket drugs ban?
wtf are blanket drugs?
legal highs are blanket drugs?
How can you ban legal highs? Isn't the point of them that they are legal?
What
You mean all legal drugs are now illegal?
So you can't buy caffeine any more?
What?
Caffeine is a legal drug
And alcohol
And tobacco
So confused...
Also, isn't nitrous oxide a really simple chemical compound which can easily be homebrewed?
It's just N2O
So they are banning sale of nitrogen and oxygen?>
Because that's all you need to make it
lmao
You can't ban that without removing lots of products and services
So I can just order it through work and put it on my expenses form then?
Do you work at a resteraunt or something?
wtf I thought I was the poorest person here
Weren't people already inhaling from whipped cream cans? At least all my friends are

heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I've decided on my next headphones
ATH-M50X
And I'm going to do a couple of mods on them so they are 'bespoke'
Because I need more versatility and comfort than the stock cans
But first I need to fix my ground loop noise issue
Do you want to buy my Beyerdynamic DT770 80Ohms headphones?
Anyeoung rory
Do you think that Ground Loop Isolator I ordered will solve my problem?
rory?
Anyeoung chingu
wtf why?
But I have a ground loop problem?
But you just said it wouldn't?!?!?!?
My mic sounds like absolute dogshit because of the ground noise right now
I've resorted to using my phone's mic for gaming
btw I've decided on what my next headphones will be
I'm going to buy ATH-M50X and perform a couple of mods on them
Replace the earpads to comfy Beyer-like ones
And replace the cable locking system
Then I'll probably leave my DT770s at the office
And maybe wrap and tie the cable a bit since it's so fucking long
So I'll probably order a 40 pack of velcro cable ties
I still want to own a Fidelio X2 by the end of the year though
lmao I got a quote for £70 to add a 3.5mm jack to my DT770s..... I could just buy a new pair of headphones
I'd probably go up to £50 at the most
Why?
I've looked on ebay for DT770s with removeable cables but can't find what I'm looking for
How do I sell my unmodded ones?>
But I have no feedback
Holy shit only £60 https://www.gumtree.com/p/headphones/audio-technica-ath-m50x-closed-studio-monitor-dj-headphones/1166045012
CBA to drive to London though

I ordered this http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/141938705019
Does it look good?
I hope it will get rid of all the noise
There's this, but it's XLR and not 3.5mm :( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Beyerdynamic-DT770-Pro-80-OHM-Fully-modded-to-perfection-Free-post-mint-cond-/131788907393?hash=item1eaf3b2381:g:WzYAAOSw~oFXGTuj

I'd need something like this http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/SHURE-TINY-Q-TA4F-4PIN-MINI-XLR-MICROPHONE-ADAPTER-FOR-ALL-WIRELESS-TRANSMITTERS-/301515313601?var=600436498128&hash=item4633b691c1:m:mT1Dn5T3wEeQ7OpmNTI4vMw
Except without the length
Because I want to use my Boompro mic cable
Finding the right adapter is hard and expensive
"4 pin mini xlr female to 3.5mm female adapter"
Like this I guess? http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/4-pin-Female-plug-Mini-TA4F-XLR-Audio-Microphone-connector-MIC-Adapter-Tini-Q-G-/231398161238?hash=item35e067bb56:g:E2kAAOSwofxUbuuU

XLR is a pain in the fucking ass
I put my DT770s on my company's internal classifieds
Shall I try this? http://www.musicmagpie.co.uk/sell-electronics/
wtf none of these trade-in sites accept DT770s but they take Beats!?!??!
Well I can get £29 for them lmao https://uk.webuy.com/product.php?sku=SHEABEYDT770PRO
That's like 34% of what they go for on ebay
lmfao
You already have DT770s though?
FUCK my road tax is increasing by over £100 http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/consumer-news/88361/tax-disc-changes-everything-you-need-to-know-about-uk-road-tax

They're making low-emission cars a lot more expensive to run
Because they're bastards
oh nvm it's only for new cars
I should avoid buying a new car for as long as possible
Because the new rates are high as fuck
He is O now
I want to buy one, but they have gone up in price a lot this year...
ffs IDK what I'm going to do with my DT770s
Yay I just improvised by using elastic bands as cable ties
Now my DT770 80Ohms headphone cable is much shorter
wtf is BHS?
Hahahaha I'm thinking of doing the opposite
I've read that the DT770s have better comfort and sound quality, but no removeable cable :(
Maybe I'll just leave them at the office full-time
Why not get a pair of open cans instead?
My AKG K702s are amazing
Most accurate, detailed at the pricepoint, and largest soundstage of any headphones ever
Really incredible headphones
Super comfy too
Have you ever tried open headphones?
Oh nice
I love how you have really similar but shitty versions of my headphones
What IEMs do you use?
I'd recommend K702s and DT770s over your current headphones btw
wtf you use your M50s in the gym?
I've thought about doing that for weightlifting, but definitely not cardio
Your earpads must stink
wtf why not?
wtf
That's creepy
ffs there were plumbers in the toilets which was putting me off my poo so I had to go use another toilets

IT is a pretty broad term

You realise IT stands for INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, right?
srsly
It's not fucking complicated
It's not a super hard concept to grasp

Now the real question is whether cryptologists work in IT or mathematics
I don't think linguistics
If it's languages maybe
ffs I hate arguing over classifications like they even matter. It's like the whole "video games is not sports" argument all over again

Gonna share it with my friend brb
Wearing a wig doesn't make you a bad person
It's his crazy racist beliefs that do
Bad government and education
Actually, it's the income inequality which is probably the main cause
Income inequality is a really serious problem in USA
It's probably a significant factor in most of their other problems
Income inequality is a factor in that
Poor people are often more religious because they don't have anything better to do
Yeah but that's also to get the poor people to vote for them

I don't use it anymore, I just use my HTC One M9
And maybe HTC 10 later this year :)
Worked fine last time I checked
My M9 is a linux ultraportable
Yeah but tablets didn't exist back then
omg Dota just got a new patch
This is going to be a fun few weeks
Or at least until next week when I get my Overwatch key!!!!!!!
Have you pre-ordered? I already promised my spare key to a friend so I can't give it to you...
Unless you convince me otherwise I guess
lmao I played Dota with my friend who had never played the game before. He had no clue what he was doing. He kept comparing it to LoL for some reason, despite me telling him it's nothing like LoL. Dota has just completely changed though, so he'll have to relearn everything again haha
IDK why people always compare Dota to LoL then get confused why the game is nothing like it
This is why LoL is a fucking terrible game https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/435irp/spoiler_h2kgaming_vs_team_vitality_eu_lcs_2016/
?
whatever m9
fuck im hungry
I forgot to take to work the packed lunch mummy made me
And forgot to meet the sandwich van
I put my IEMs on just so she will stop telling me to turn my music volume down so I can hear her
Because now I can't hear her even though my IEMs aren't plugged in
That'll teach her for talking to herself
Anyeoung Plouescat
anyeoung hasseyo chingu
fuck I'm so hungry and I don't have time to go to the gym and go to LIDL
maybe I'll just skip the gym today
I'm so fucking hungry
hahahahha kimchi
My friend invited me to go to Amsterdam with him
He just got back with his gf, but now he wants to go with me
YAY THORPE PARK TOMORROW
TRIP TO POOLE NEXT WEEK
THEN TWO TRIPS TO ANDOVER
HOME TIME NOW BYE
What PSI should I use for my car? https://goo.gl/photos/PshQ4H3jmoLFRec67
IDK why it has 32 and 34
I wish people had a better understanding of economics and costs, so they don't ask me for money I don't owe them or don't pay money that they owe me
Because I CBA to give them an economics lesson every time they try to rip me off
Steam accepts Bitcoin payment now?
And Brazil?
They paid £2 to use the heater at Thorpe Park to dry off. I got bored waiting for them and climbed inside. They claim I now owe them £1 for using it wtf
Like it costs them more if I wait inside than outside it
It's a fucking public good once they've paid for it, what do they expect me to do, just wait outside for them instead of coming in too?
There's no reason I can't benefit from it too
They're just being stingy twats
They work at Tesco
They're also disputing the £37 they agreed to pay me weeks ago for the Thorpe Park trip. We got back yesterday and now they're saying they don't want to pay me because they estimate my car running costs are less than I asked them for.
Sorry, £39 not £37
I had wealthier friends at uni
I just told him that he's in breach of contract law
Since we agreed a contract and I have delivered my part
So he's being a dick
Well yeah, pretty much any voluntary agreement is
I'm not going to take him to small claims court or anything, just telling him he's being a dick and wouldn't get away with it if it was a larger amount
If you fulfil your part, then I guess so?
I think there's laws against sexual services though
Yeah it's probably illegal in the UK
In Germany is another matter
I mean if you go into a brothel and pay them for a service, then they've got to fulfil their part
I think so, I'm not an expert on German law though
holy shit your rent is expensive
LMAO I said "you're legaly bound to pay me £39" and he said "you're just making excuses"
Maybe I should take him to court
Would be funny
yeah it's only £39, it's not worth it
I told him I'm not going to bother taking him to court, it would just be nice if he'd pay what he agreed to not what he thinks it costs me
I would have agreed a lower amount if he said something a couple of weeks ago
I think he's pretty pissed off with me now, thinking I am overcharging him
He told me he trusted that I would set a fair price
yesterday he thought Thorpe Park was a great day out for only £39
Today he thinks I am a horrible person ripping him off
I told him he can just have the day for free. If he pays me £33 (what he wants to pay me, not the £39 we agreed) then I will just send it back. I won't accept part-payment
IDK what I'll do about his friend who owes me £6 still though
They think I'll be profiting even paying me £33 wtf
I organised the event and drove them there and back whilst they were getting wasted, got them super cheap tickets, and they think I'm somehow profiting from it.
They won't accept the calculations because "paying for wear and tear" is ridiculous
I told them that my employer pays me 45p per mile for fuel, wear and tear and depreciation, and that I'm charging them a lot less than that divided between the three of us, and they're still saying they won't pay it and that I'm profiting from them
They're either stupid or assholes or both
Especially since we fucking agreed on £39 two fucking weeks ago
45p a mile is what my employer pays me. 29p is what I asked my friends agreed to pay me, 6p is what they say they will pay me now.
29p is what they agreed to pay me*
s/6/17.65/
And they say I'm being unreasonable and profiting from them
Even though I got them cheap tickets through work and gave them a discount on mileage
If they got the train it would cost them so much more
Or a coach
Or literally anything
Fuck sake, the "in" and "out" on my ground loop isolator is the wrong way. I'll have to buy an adaptor....
Two adaptors even...
Fuck I'm just throwing hardware at the problem at this point
hum stop box is an accurate name too I guess
Although it's not always a hum
"noise filter box" or "noise stop box"
I need to buy adapter for it and I'm not even sure if it'll work yet
two adapters*
I'm thinking of upgrading my Fiio E10K to an AMPDAC with a mic input so I solve the ground loop problem
Maybe an Asus Xonar U7
Or a Creative Sound Blader Omni
Or an O2+ODAC
Which do you think I should buy?
wtf
nice m9
I don't have space for any internal cards
My Fiio E10K is great, it just doesn't have a mic input
$2 is all you need to spend on an ampdac apparently http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/high-end-pc-audio,review-32894-19.html
If I can't fix the ground loop problem, I'll probably buy this https://www.jdslabs.com/products/48/objective2-odac-combo-revb/#
oh it's not mic input
It just routes the audio back out....
Which do you think looks best? https://www.amazon.co.uk/Creative-Performance-Headphone-Integrated-Microphone/dp/B00F8VB0IW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1461922476&sr=8-1&keywords=creative+omni

Or this https://www.amazon.co.uk/Creative-Sound-Blaster-System-Preamp/dp/B00GMDWNJK/ref=sr_1_2?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1461922767&sr=1-2&keywords=creative+x-fi
Those purchase advice threads don't really help, because I am looking for something so specific
Finding a high-end AMPDAC with a mic input is so hard
Is this a good post? https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/4gthbx/daily_headphone_purchase_advice_thread_20160428/d2lvznj
Will I get some good advice from that?
Well technically it's an Amp+DAC put together into a single enclosure. AMPDAC is just much more convenient to type
wow that website is kinda creepy
haha
I create new accounts every couple of years
Do you think my post will get a helpful response though?
IDK like £200 I guess
wtf no you weren't
How much do you actually bench?
60 then?
stop lying omfg
wtf
?
I am eating a chicken, bacon, avacado and mayo sandwich
I bought it from the sandwich van
What did you downvote me three times for?
Would be interesting to know
Do you ever submit posts even though you know it will probably get downvoted?
lmao
you know karma doesn't actually have any value, right?
They're just imaginary internet points
guess so
lmao tumblr
I heard that tumblr has one of the worse communities on the internet
Use encryption
Or a VPN
You need to circumvent the throttling!!!!
What do you think of this? https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00LC1VKY6/
Does this look good? https://www.amazon.co.uk/Creative-E5-Portable-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B00OYZP6G0/ref=pd_cp_23_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=XWFA7N4GSS3V4KVSDE7M
Yeah but it has mic input...
I don't have a spare PCI slot
Creative E5 looks like my best bet ATM
I'll look into it more this weekend
I'd rather not pay for all the extra features I don't need though
Yeah and super easy to switch headsets too
With just the boompro cable
I ordered M50X last night
And some parts to mod it
Gonna mod them
velour earpads and remove the cable locking system
So they're comfier and works with boompro
Why?
Didn't know you have M50s
Locks the cable in place
And it prevents other 3.5mm cables from being used
I might sell my Fiio E10K if I can't get the ground loop problem solved
Yeah
Prevents you from using Boompro or any other cable
I hate vendor lock-in
rats wtf
you can remove the cable locking system and put any random cable in there
I love how the IT team is currently having a discussion behind me about how some people are shirking and not resolving enough helpdesk tickets
I ordered the Creative E5
I'll be selling my Fiio E10K soon
I was worried about the lack of Linux support, but they have an Android app which is a decent workaround
It's got a lot of features on the hardware itself and Creative don't supply drivers for Linux
The soundcard itself works fine, but a lot of the DAC features are proprietary
Hmmmm I've read that my headset mic might not work with the Creative E5 on Linux
Yes
It has three built-in mics which I can use until I figure out how to reverse-engineer drivers for it I guess
Sure, I'll just learn how to be a computer programmer, can't be that hard
lmao
I'll give you £50 and a blowjob if you port the WIndows driver to Linux
I only listen to kpop, not shit like that
These are cheap atm http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/offer-listing/B00PK2LJ4E/?condition=used
Do you use Creative Sound Blaster E5? I just ordered one

The cool thing about my Creative Sound Blaster E5 is that it's not just an AMPDAC, but a feature-full sound system
That I can control with my phone
There's so many features!
I just got two debit cards
Never going to use them
I just wanted the switching bonus
I'll keep them until I switch them to another bank account
hahaha I applied for a £2,700 overdraft just to see if I'd be successful
I had to phone them and they kept asking me what I wanted the money for and I kept giving them really vague anwers
I just said I wanted it there in case I needed it
And the man on the other end kept asking me what I needed it for
IDK
Mainly the £25 interest-free amount in case I get into trouble I guess
I would rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it
I ordered this http://uk.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/sound-blaster-e5
Do you think this is better? http://uk.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/sound-blaster-x7
Yeah but I'm not sure which to buy
The E5 is £100 cheaper
But I think the X7 might have better audio quality
Yeah but I hate paying for things twice
The cheaper one is also 1kg lighter
And doesn't require a power brick
Yeah...
The cheaper one also has a battery and dual headphone outputs, but IDK if I'll use those features
I'm generally more interested in audio quality than value-added-features
I use my HTC phone as my portable source
Yeah
Why?
I'm still pissed off with my dumbass friend for calling me a greedy jew for asking him to pay me 1/3 of the £50 we agreed for the 170 mile trip
Well no, it's 170 miles between the three of uus
So he owes me for 56 miles
29p a mile
He doesn't drive though
Yeah instead of paying me £17 like we agreed 2 weeks ago, he changed his mind AFTER the trip
Telling me that £17 for a 170 mile trip is an unreasonable cost
I told him he should have said something two weeks ago and he tells me "I trusted you to set a reasonable price"
How am I supposed to argue with that? I just told him that we had a contract and that he should honour it because I CBA to take him to small claims court
I got fed up of him telling me I'm greedy and making excuses, so in the end I told him that I CBA and he can have the trip for free
Well he owes me for the tickets and parking too
He says he'll pay me for the tickets and parking and £11/£17 that I asked for the mileage
I haven't received any payment though, and I CBA to chase it
What phrase?
I was pretty clear with the price two weeks ago
And didn't get any disputes
I'm not really bothered about the money, I'm pissed off that he's calling me a greedy jew
He told me it's ridiculous that I included wear and tear into my mileage calculation and not just fuel, is it?
Well we brought his mate and the two of them made the decision together not to pay me
I got £33 from his friend on the day, but he said he needed to get the remaining £6 for me later
I bought the tickets and the parking and drove
I feel like I've been lied to and taken advantage of and insulted at the same time
If they had any concerns with the price they should have said something weeks ago
They got a super cheap trip out of it because they aren't paying me the amount we agreed on
I asked for £39 each which covers their tickets to Thorpe Park, 170 mile round trip and parking
Yeah but they told me I'm being a greedy jew for asking for that much
The queues were almost non-existant too
Alton Towers is a lot further from my location
"Fucking wear and tear costs is a ridiculous thing to expect us to pay for"
"Why are you overcharging us so much?"
"I trusted you to set a fair fuel price and tore overcharging by at least £7"
"Were you trying to charge £10 for fuel and £7 wear and tear?"
"Fuel calculators are putting the cost at between £5-£10 each"
"You're trying to rip me off, how is that nice?"
"I'll give you £33
Same as jack has
And you'll still be making a profit"
I love how he wants to set a new price by himself two weeks later and after I deliver my part
As if he ordered a fancy dinner from a resteraunt and then told them he's going to pay them less than he should
Doubt it, he's too busy living with his parents for free, working at Tesco, going on trips to Europe all the time, and saying "£7 is a lot for me"
His parents also let his gf stay for free, and he told me he doesn't want to move out and live with his gf because he doesn't want to pay rent
Whilst also telling me I'm the tight person
Yeah for a few years now
He has a job as a personal trainer for a little while
had*
It's pretty fucking pathetic if I've just lost a friend over £6
He basically only wants to pay me 19p per mile
But no company would ever consider that enough for mileage
I already let him off
He's obviously not going to pay me
CBA to argue over it
I'm still pissed about it thoguh
I told him he can have the trip for free
Thus absolving him from his contractual obligations
Otherwise I'd probably have to take him to court to get the money back
And I've got better things to do than that
"Make sure you and Jack bring £20 each for the tickets and £19 for fuel and parking on Wednesday."
I didn't intend to be owed any money
They just didn't turn up with the money
Me too
goodnight m9
well
We saw a shitload of jews at Thorpe Park
Must have been a jew day out or something
They were all over the place, it was crazy!
I've never seen so many jews in my life
Hmmmm from his messages he seems to acknowledge that wear and tear exists, but claim that he shouldn't be paying for it, and that I am profiting even if he's not paying for it
wtf is this you? https://youtu.be/Thx7jrRkvqQ
Timestamp https://youtu.be/Thx7jrRkvqQ?t=12m20s
I guess it's true that white people all look the same
I fucked up again
Modded my new M50s that arrived today, then forgot I need a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter
So now my headphones are unusable
I would just put the locking mechanism back in, but that means I have to open them up twice more
Which will risk breaking them
I'll just have to wait between 9th - 31st May to use them....
They're very nice headphones though
They sound really nice, and have fantastic build quality
The earpads were fucking tiny and pretty shit
So I replaced them with some super comfy ones
haha like when I'm in the gym and trying to bench 60KG
The headband is made of leather, but not replaceable, which could be a problem in the future....
haha yeah, I might wear them in the office when people want to talk to me
Because I always get accused of listening to music too loud, when I'm actually just trying to avoid talking to them
And I won't even have the cable plugged in
To the headphones
I wear my DT770s without them plugged into my source sometimes
But with my M50s I can wear them without them plugged into the headphones at all!
These are great earpads btw Arriving 9 May - 31 May 
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00MFDT894/
Nice view m9
They're 100X more comfy than the stock M50 earpads
Na
The stock pads were pressed up close to my ears, giving them no space, no room to breath, they're made of leather and felt like shit compared to my super comfy K702s and DT770s
Leatherette then whatever
You definitely should
I only had the stock pads on for 10 mins before I got fed up with them
You should mod the cable locking system too
I never intended to use unmodded M50s
Have you ever used the stock M50 earpads?
Shit, I just cut my finger somehow
I hate the inconvenience and danger of motorbikes
I prefer not dying when a van drives into me
If I broke my headphones during modding, I won't know for at least a week....
Because I need the 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter to use them
The M50s look really nice, definitely very stylish headphones compared to the DT770s
rory and I are headphones enthusiasts
rory is interested in my opinions on headphones
What headphones do you use?
I haven't reached endgame yet, so I am still researching and testing
lmfao
You've never experienced high fidelity audio
Sure, I'll take pics of my M50s for you
Any specific angles you want?
Any way you want me to position them?
Oh god that sounds sexy
I'll put these on my gf...
I bet she'd look great in my M50s
Whose fetish is fat people again?
I keep forgetting all your fetishes
I should note them all down for future reference
I don't have a fetish because I'm not a fucking perv
2016-05-04 19:03:45 Lord-Harlot  [19:03:31]  (+davehamil) I should note them all down for future blackmail
ffs I'm so fucking sick of people telling me this. Just because I have an Asian gf doesn't mean I have yellow fever omg
Only because they are objectively more attractive
ffs on Friday I was told I needed to do a webinar for something but I forgot what it was, and now I'm too embarassed to ask
Wednesday, 4 May
04:32 Parcel left the carrier facility 
KOBERN-GONDORF, RP, DE
I'm still pissed off my friend unfriended me because he wants to save £5 after agreeing 29p a mile with me
Why do headphones with single cables always have the cable on the left earcup?
Today I am wearing my M50X but without a cable
Because I don't have a cable for them any more
Because I modified them so they don't work with the supplied cables any more
Because I want to use them with my V-Moda Boompro
Have you played Overwatch yet?
I think the open beta has started now, or starting today
I've been playing it over the last couple of days with my friend
He really likes it, and I'm having lots of fun too
I would have given you one of my beta keys, but I only had 2
But it's open beta now, so we can play together ^^
Yeah so come join us and have lots of fun!
You'll love it
Because it's a really fun game?
geeez don't be so cynical m9!
wtf?
If it's harmless fun, why would you not want to play it?
I wouldn't call it "harmless"
It's cancer
wtf is wrong with you? I invite you to do some fun activities with me and you respond with only hostility?!?
You're no better than my shithead friend who agreed to pay me £39 then unfriended me because he didn't want to pay me that much any more
I try to do something nice for people and they just throw it back in my face omfg!
These velcro cable ties are fantastic
40 for £8.99
Makes cable management so easy!
Cables are fucking annoying. I wish we had unlimited mobile power and bandwidth with zero latency
Should I buy this? https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-Premium-Auxiliary-Headphones-iPhones/dp/B00R16XQDE or this? https://www.amazon.co.uk/3-5mm-Stereo-Jack-Plug-1-2M-Black/dp/B00077DC3S/
Should I pay 6X the price for a cable which does the same thing?
Yeah because you're using the shitty stock tiny leather earpads lmao
You should get the earpads I did, they are wayyyyyyyy nicer
These are the ones I ordered https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00MFDX4YO/ref=twister_B00PGMY2OC
Black velour, I definitely recommend them
They increased the comfort of my M50s by over 9000%
You should also unscrew the left earcup and remove the cable locking mechanism whilst you're modding the earpads
So you can use them with V-moda Boompro and/or that Anker cable I just linked in the channel
I never bought my M50Xs intended not to mod them
They have a lot more potential than Audio-Technica made them
The moment I put them on, my ears felt like they were trapped in an insulated prison
The stock earpads are made of leather and insulate the heat around your ears, so they will get warm over time
They are also super small and my ears touched the side of the headphones and the earpads touched my ear all around the circumfrance
I'm used to really large and comfy velour earpads like on my DT770s and K702s.
They're far comfier because your ears don't actually touch the earpads and the only contact your head has with the headphones is on the headband and a larges velour circumfrances around the sides of your head
It especially makes a difference if you wear glasses, because it doesn't push the frames of your glasses against your temples
YES my new headphone amp is arriving today!!!!
I thought I wouldn't get it until Monday, so after the Overwatch beta
Hey
I'm upgrading my Fiio E10K today ^^
Basic income will be low though
The wealthy don't want the poor to have any money
It won't be higher than state pension anyway
Basic income solves eligibility more than wealth
Cuts out all the wasteful admin and uncertainty
It would solve extreme poverty for sure
The poor and homeless would have an income to rely on
Rather than dependant on benefits which public bodies constantly threaten to take away
wtf is scss
dcss
wtf why?
A year ago I would never have considered spending £160 on a headphone amp
But now I have
I love having money
I want to save up and upgrade my PC
Needs more processing power!!!!!
I pay more rent to my parents than I would if I rented some places
£350 a month, and I found somewhere for £300 a month closer to work last night
Bills included
I don't eat  that much food
I don't get much food from my mother because she steals alcohol out of my room and falls asleep and forgets to cook for me
I'm mostly just living at home for the free laundry atm
Yeah she stole a bottle of Jack Daniels out of my room yesterday and drank it all and I got home to find her asleep
She had better replace that
Whenever I leave alcohol in my room that isn't beer, she steals it wtf
hahahaha I'm not much of a whisky drinker, so I would never have good whisky
yay my headphone amp has arrived
What incentive do people have to leave feedback on ebay?
yay my 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter for my M50X has arrived!
Gonna plug my M50X into my V-Moda Boompro into my Creative E5 into my gaming PC tonight
My friend just bought that headset and his mic sounds fucking awful when we Skype
The headphones are okay at the price though
Ummm no, HyperX has a shit mic
Also, the headphones aren't very good for gaming because they are too bassy
My Creative E5 won't work with my work laptop because I can't install the driver, and I have to wait for it to charge before I can use it with my phone :(
Or maybe I can plug my phone into it whilst it's also connected to my PC
Hmmm it seems to stop charging when I plug my phone into it
I think I need to just let it charge up before I use it
Hopefully it'll be charged by hometime
I'll give you a message
And do what?
Show you my modded M50X?
wtf is a TOSLINK cable
I think I got one in the box with my Creative E5
What is optical audio used for?
Yeah USB because it's an Amp+DAC
If I wanted to use it just as an Amp I would use line-in probably
I'm not sure what's the point of optical
TOSLINK isn't analogue?
What's the point of using it over USB then?
I doubt it's a feature I'll use then. I'll probably just use USB and use my mic in the toslink port
It's a combined line/mic/optical in port
I'm going to leave my V-Moda Boompro cable permanently connected and just plug different headphones into the cable
So I have multiple headsets
Well they're all the same sized hole
So they will all fit in
It's not a high-end mic, it's only £25
https://www.amazon.co.uk/V-MODA-BoomPro-Gaming-Headphone-Microphone-Black/dp/B00BJ17WKK
I'm using that with my K702s and M50X
Yeah, and my port is line/mic/optical in
It's a nice-have, but IDK if I'll be using it
Can I get Hi Fi monitor speakers which will work with my AMPDAC's line out?
It's mini TOSLINK I think
But I can get decent high-end speakers? Not £1000 ones
Yeah and a shitload of £££
I'm talking about consumer gear
brb
How much would that cost?
I don't think I'll want to spend too much on speakers
I might not even buy any for quite some time
Since I have a Creative E5 now, if someone wants to listen/watch with me, they can just use headphones
Because my Creative E5 has dual headphone output
I tried watching some TV with a Chinese girl in my room on my monitor's speakers and they were fucking awful, we could barely hear the sound
Yeah but I didn't want to go into my storage and find the Creative 5.1 speaker kit
Haha be sure to make a joke about that in the interview
I want 8 hours to pass already so my Creative E5 is fully charged so I can go use it
Are you a stuperstitious person?
wtf
Yeah like I never put sugar in my drinks or drink caffeine after 17:00
HOME TIME NOW BYE
My Creative E5 is pretty good
But I accidentally bought a 2.5mm female to 3.5mm male adapter instead of a 3.5mm female to 2.5mm male adapter
So I still can't use my M50X :(
It's not normally laggy, but that doesn't necessarily mean your internet connection is bad.,
Junkrat
Do you think this will sell? http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/-/222112087591?
Why not?
Oh yeah I see
I just did what ebay suggested
Can I change the postage to free?
I want to start using ebay so I can sell other shit when I upgrade it
Like old PC parts
How else do you suggest I sell my shit?
Isn't Reddit unsafe?
lmao so many people selling their 970/980
£190 http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/MSI-GeForce-GTX-970-4GD5T-OC-EDITION-Perfect-condition-in-original-packaging-/322101741364?hash=item4afec28734:g:CJ0AAOSwShJXL2EW
I'm thinking of buying an Ncase M1
Oh cool!
What's inside it?
I'm thinking of buying Ncase M1 and a Corsair H100
What's inside yours?
I want to OC my 4690K
So I can play Overwatch at more than the shitty 230FPS I have now
wtf why?
I want to get the new case and cooler so that I will be able to OC my next CPU whatever that will be in the future
You can fit large heatsinks in small cases with AIOs
I'm using Open HW monitor to see whether my CPU usage or GPU usage is causing the bottleneck
At lowest graphics settings, my 4690K seems to be bottlenecking my GTX 970
No, why?
I'll consider selling my Fiio E10K for £30+P&P
High refresh rate is important to minimise input lag
I usually just link people this video instead of arguing about this nowadays https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjWSRTYV8e0
I just tried on my old Corsair Vengeance 1500 to see how much of a difference my AMPDAC+headphones make. The difference was massive
So much more detail and enjoyment
I probably still won't ever spend more than £200 on an AMPDAC or £300 on a pair of headphones tthough
It gets too expensive for rapidly diminishing returns
I'm near my endgame already I think
Just wanna get some Fiio X2s now....
Those headphones look fucking amazing
My monitor is 189hz
I'm probably going to upgrade to a 480hz monitor later this year
AOC 2460PQU overclocked
Did you even watch the fucking video?
No, most CS:GO players chase high framerate too
yes ofc
wat
Maybe you should fuck her
wtf
wtf why?
?????????????
What are your specs?
Yeah but what CPU cooler?!?!??!??
lmfao wtf
Why would you spend so much on a case and not put a high performance cooler in it?
Why did you buy the Ncase M1? What motrivated you to buy it?
So you can OC your CPU for more perofrmance maybe?
wtf
You really think a 3.5ghz processor is just as fast as a 4.5?
Or get a H100 then upgrade CPU later
My 4690K is pretty fast, I just need to OC it
An OCed 4690K will be faster than a 4790K
H100 isn't really mediocre
Yeah but it'll be used for future CPUs too
The H100 will push air onto the board too
lemme know if you want to buy my E10K for £30+P&P
BEDTIME NOW
GOT WORK TODAY FUCK
Anyeoung rory
I was talking to my Korean gf on Skype last night
I told her that she can live with me if she pays rent
She didn't like that
She wants me to pay most of the rent
Yeah I guess so, but she works in Brighton and it's hard for her to find a job here because she doesn't speak English very well
IDK whether to buy Ncase M1 + Corsair H100 or not
A slightly higher framerate would be nice
But £300 is a lot of money
But I have so much money IDK what to do with it
lmao that joke is so old
I have so much money IDK what to do with it....
For what?
Money is pointless unless you spend it
I'm running out of shit to buy
Already bought lots of headphones and amps and dacs
If I save too much and lose my job, I won't get benefits
I will be told just to live off my savings
So it's a bad idea to save if your employment is uncertain
£80 a week is better than £0
Actually, I was getting £57 a week
There's also housing benefit if you are a woman
I have a Creative E5 external soundcard now
I couldn't get my mic to work on Linux.........
But it's a very nice AMPDAC
I can plug my custom-built headset into it
wtf is what-network?
What did I ask there?
Something about what AMPDAC to buy I think
Then I found the Creative E5
And bought it
It's got a battery and it's portable like your Fiio E17K, but I'll probably just use my HTC One M9 as a source because it's more convenient
wtf about it looks retarded?
You're looking at the Creative X7?
Yeah it has dual headphone output, that's probably why you think it looks so weird
NFC too
And 3 microphones
And a hardware EQ
I prefer the ODAC because it's a single unit
GTX 970
You can get one dirt cheap in a few weeks
And it's a great card
If you can get one for £150 you will get a bargain
np
I might be selling my GTX 970
hahahahhahaha hell no
The queen is ugly
Ugly old woman
When taking my regular commute out of my mileage claim, should I calculate the walking distance, cycling distance, or driving distance?
because walking distance is shorter, so I can claim more mileage
hell no
Would take fucking ages
It's over 6 miles
What about routes?
Should I claim for the longest, shortest, or fastest?
yay £118.80 once it gets authorised and payday
wtf why do you have foster parents?
Maybe you should just answer the question
You know the old saying "if everyone is an asshole you are"
Or something like that
wtf
How old are you?
IDK rory likes to joke that I am an autist or something
omg only £27k with £130 monthly rent and £52 service charges http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/40242891#y03YDlSY35uG6hyO.97
Should I buy it?
wow council tax+mortgage+rent+service charge and it's still cheaper than living with my parents
25% share
omg £102 a month council tax wtf
That's insane
That's higher than the mortgage payments
Nope, only ever rented rooms
You don't pay council tax unless you rent an entire property
Although I have a suspicion my mother is factoring council tax into my rent
Have you ever rented a room before?
Can I get a mortgage if I've recently started a new job?
I love how I can pay rent, service charges, mortgage, energy and water bills for less than my mother is charging me for a room in her house
Actually, even with council tax included, it's still less than my mum was charging me last year for a single room
mortgage+rent+council tax+service charges+water+energy combined is cheaper than my mum charged me lmao
Although my mum did cook for me most days
But that often results in overeating or undereating
Or food I don't like
If I can't get a mortgage, then I can't buy it
Simple as that.
I don't have enough money to buy the entire 25% share
I have enough for a 20% deposit
That's with a buffer too
What do you mean exactly?
People with small deposits?
Why?
It's really hard to tell if you're being sarcastic or not
I hate them
I never answer the phone nowadays
If someone wants to get in touch with me they can send me a text message
And I'll call them back if I want to speak to them
so vi must deal vit it
Vulkan>DX12 obviously
DX12 is pointless
wtf this financial assessment website just sent me my username and password in plaintext by email
Are they fucking retarded
Wanna buy my Fiio E10K £30+P&P?
I've had a couple of offers so far, one for £30 and another for £31.50
But I think I want the full price on ebay because of the sellers fee
You definitely should, spend £100 on a decent pair of cans and £30 on my Fiio E10K and you will have amazing sound quality for years
Compared to whatever cheap shit you're currently listening to
You're probably missing out on a lot of the sound
I'm also selling my Beyer DT770 80ohms which are an amazing pairing with my Fiio E10K
I'll sell them both for £110+P&P
Would you recommend Fiio E10K and Beyer DT770s to HansProleman?
DT770s are good because they have such good isolation and detail that you don't need to raise the volume high and give yourself tinnitus
Ignorance is for plebs
Well you won't make it worse then
You could get super tinnitus if you use shit headphones
Also, DT770s are super fucking comfy
Replace the pads?
IDK never needed to replace them
Don't think they're too expensive
£3 https://www.amazon.co.uk/Replacement-Cushions-DT770-DT551-DT660---Black/dp/B00C3BEREY/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1462883183&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=dt770+earpad
The headband is replaceable too
And they're open and non-bassy which turn a lot of people off
And less comfy than DT770
It was me!
lmao no
They're for plebs
You'd love it
The 80ohm ones are definitely the best unless you have a high-end amp
What's he going to use them? On-board audio?
The 80ohm ones sound way better, especially when paired with an E10K
wtf one of my colleagues is doing money laundering training today
I'm surprised that my employer trains us to do illegal things
Or Takstar Pro 80
You're just compromising too much unless you get a decent ampdac though
I wouldn't recommend anything less than a Fiio E10K
It's too good at the pricepoint
Anything below its price is shit in comparison
Definitely, that's why they were my first headphones and ampdac. I wanted amazing sound but didn't want to pay much for it
I still love my beyers, but they're pretty useless for gaming now I've sold my modmic
They're great for the office though, but I might just use my M50X for that too now
I think having both DT770s and M50X is probably a waste since they're relatively similar headphones?
I think the M50X is a bit more portable and the DT770s have a bit larger soundstage and sub bass
The DT770s probably have better sound quality in general
But I'll just get Fidelio X2 if I want godlike sound quality anyway
I don't need Fidelio X2, M50X K702 AND DT770s
And Shure SE215 lmao
I think my DT770s don't fill a niche I'm not filling with my other headphones
They don't have as good sound quality as Fidelio X2s, don't have as good isolation as SE215 or sound quality, don't have the soundstage or detail of my K702s
So my DT770s are amazing at everything, but I just want niche headphones so I can swap depending on which strength I need
Whether it's pwning n00bs in CS:GO or travelling on the train or in the office or the gym or listening to music at home
My DT770s don't fit into my lineup any more
And I can't plug my V-Moda Boompro into it either
Having no cables makes managing 3 headphones much easier
I just hang them up on the headphone stands on the sides of my monitors
I can't go on holidays because I have rent and mortgage and council tax and bills to pay :(
Can I come?
To Amsterdam?
Will we do drugs?
yay
Will we hire prostitutes?
wtf why not
No it's not fun if I do it alone
It's creepy
Exactly
well technically you're not from the internet, you're from leeds
yeah whatever
I'm from EU West m9
I met my gf from the internet
I was doing goblin squats yesterday because I read that smith machine squats are bad and I don't have a free bar
So I just did goblin squats with a 16kg kettle bell
Do you do squats?
I was ofc wtf
Why would I have a smith machine at home?!?!?
No
To clarify, the office gym I use only has a smith machine
It's only an office gym, so it's not very big
Well, it has other stuff too
But not a free bar
Dumbells and kettle bells aren't really heavy enough
I need a big bar with lots of weight
The bar is fixed to the smith machine
 I'd prefer a free bar, but we don't have one
I need a free bar to do squats
I don't mind benchpress or OHP too much on the smith machine
But for squats it's not very good
Do I need to tell you things you don't know?
Our dumbells only go up to 12.5kg, and it's really awkward to hold more than one
Do you hold two dumbells?
How? What's your grip?
Got a pic/video of the movement?
Interesting
My legs go really wide so I can fit my belly between my legs when I do squats
Hmmmm that second pic could work
Because holding 12+kg in your arm and keeping it stable whilst moving up and down can be a little tricky
I might give dumbell squats a try
That way I can go up to 25kg from 16kg
My flexibility is pretty bad
My feet don't rest flat on the ground :(
wat
Do you not have anything better to do than argue with random people on the internet?
Remind me never to do silly hitler poses with my dog
CBA to sign up for Facebook to upload shitty videos
I hope my 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter arrives tomorrow
Then I can give you my opinion of my M50X
hahahahahahaha yeah
Modded them so they aren't shit like most M50Xs
Although I can't plug a cable into them ATM so that kinda sucks
Haven't been able to use them since I got them
Can you get me a discount on EE broadband?
If I move into my own flat?
fucking hell internet is expensive
£17+ a month wtf
It is?
Most seem around £17-£18
I think HansProleman might want it + my beyers
DT770 80 Ohms
Do I need a landline?
wtf? It's the most popular version
I never answer the phone though?
There's a 250 version
But those are 16 ohms?
Plug them into the back
Get a Fiio E10K then
Holy shit t his looks like a good deal https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/sim_only_deal/2d21367826963ec7f658f28505a6bf6e243c9616?page=%2Fmobiles%2Fcompare%2Fsim_only_deals%2F&position=2&sorted_by=monthly_cost
1.5GB of data for £5 a month
What's the catch?
An extra 1GB for the same price is tempting
I'll keep letting my mum pay for it until she stops
£13 too expensive
No idea
lmao thats a fucking joke
I don't want to pay for shitty line rental
BUT I  DON'T WANT TO
ffs they're exploiting my internet addiction
wtf is gigabit
My friend was on the local news last night http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/news/14482624.Recovering_addict_obsessed_with_Nazis_shouted_racial_abuse_and_bit_his_mum/
Met him when I started uni I think
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic
I'm not sure everything in that article is true
It seems so strange, and tabloids always make stuff up
I think he has mental problems from doing too many drugs
God my Beyer DT770s sound amazing on my Creative E5
Do you like my new headphone amp? https://www.amazon.co.uk/Creative-E5-Portable-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B00OYZP6G0
It's more a sound card than a headphone amp
It's got a fuckload of features
3 built-in microphones
Dual headphone outputs
Line out
Line/mic/optical in
Hardware EQ
Hardware SBX Pro Studio
Hardware profiles
no ofc not wtf
Yes, it sounds very good
That's why I bought it
It has a built-in battery too
And NFC
And Bluetooth
Yes
I think my 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter will arrive today, so I can finally use my M50X headphones ^^
Do you do any gaming?
What do you play?
The beta has ended now
The release date is the 24th
omg I can pay rent, council tax, service charges, water, electricity, gas, internet, contents insurance, and mobile phone for less than what my parents are charging me
I'm trying
Finally found somewhere I like
Now I'm speaking to a mortgage consultant to get an affordability assessment
Then I will ask the housing association for a viewing
And buy the flat hopefully
http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/40242891#cOPkvl346jD4Avpa.97
Why is it a pro choice?
It's the same housing association I work at...
Yeah my colleagues are pretty nice
£130 rent and £52 service charge is so good
25%
£130 rent on the remaining 75%
That's cheaper rent than most 50% ownership
contracting?!?!??!?
wat
How much do I need to budget for food? £150-£200?
My plan is to pay off the mortgage in 5 years, sell it, and use the deposit for 100% ownership
Or just rent there for cheap
What's your food budget?
I could staircase to 100% ownership too, but people warn me about staircasing because it's "expensive"
I wouldn't do it incrementally, I'd do it 25% to 100% probably
 No reason to do it less than that
wtf
ffs I have to do this to make a tutorial today http://www.bu.edu/tech/services/comm/conf/lync/about/screen-capture/
That's what the Nazis said and look what happened to them
Tell your boss that he isn't a Nazi
Or that he is
Ask your boss's boss to tell your boss that he pays him so should leave you alone
Or blackmail his gf
Actually
Don't do anything illegal because then I'll get blamed for telling you
Just do something illegal that I haven't suggested yet
wtf why do my colleagues always call directories "folders"?
And they call workboots "spreadsheets" and spreadsheets "tabs" wtf
s/workboots/workbooks/
No omg a spreadsheet is a spreadsheet, it's not fucking complicated
I know what a fucking spreadsheet is
I already did and told everyone they are retarded for not knowing what a spreadsheet is
This is 2 doors down from the flat I want, same property value and number of bedrooms, so it's possible it's the same as the one I'm looking at, except it has a lot more photos, floorplan, and information http://www.rightmove.co.uk/house-prices/detailMatching.html/svr/3122?prop=49137494&sale=3897598&country=england
What do you think?
Is there space to put a desk?
Yeah it's owned by the housing association
I'll have to take measurements at the viewing then I guess
Do flats come with washing machines/dishwashers? Or will I need to buy them?
omfg
If it's a housing association shared ownership does that make a difference?
About whether machines are included!!!!
Do I need to buy an oven!??!?
Yay a fridge and a freezer <3
Small appliances are much easier to procure than large machines
And easier to install
I can just get a cheap kettle and toaster and microwave and toastie maker
Yeah
Got to wait until December so I get some good shit for my birthday
I'll just not drink tea or eat toast until then
I could just not drink tea
I could drink water or some shit instead
tea addict
I'm addicted to kpop and esports
omg my adapter has arrived
Can't wait to take it home and listen to my new bespoke Audio Technica M50X
It's a one of a kind
Heavily modified
I hope it still works properly
It's reversible
I haven't damaged it
Sure, and I should buy a Ferrari whilst I'm at it
Yes, I recently upgraded my amp and bought other pairs of headphones
Call sell them both for £110+P&P if you want
When it comes to expensive electronics, definitely
I wash my hair before every time I wear my headphones
They aren't old enough / I'm clean enough for them to be in pretty good condition. Plus, you can replace the earpads for like £3 if you ever need to
velour is best IMO
stock velour
Velour is comfier too
Doesn't make your ears hot
Not sure, have to look it up
I'll look it up tonight
I don't have paypal, can you do bank transfer?
I've sold stuff on here with bank transfer without problems before
k
Unlike my dickhead friends, I fulfil my contracted legal obligations
I'm still pissed about that
They think I only planned the day out to make a profit wtf
They're fucking retarded
No
Probably
Probably comfier too
They're sooooooooooo comfy
Do you wear glasses?
Do you ever get discomfort when earpads push the frames of your glasses into the side of your head?
I always had that with cheap headphones
The Beyers are great for glasses wearers because the earpads are so large that they don't cause discomfort when wearing glasses
Yeah but they're gonna be 50k in debt soon
And they'll be paying above-interest rates on it
And it won't be written off until they either retire or die
Same, I met this guy there http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/news/14482624.Recovering_addict_obsessed_with_Nazis_shouted_racial_abuse_and_bit_his_mum/
Also lots of Chinese girls
hahahahaha
They really liked it when I approached them
I was really good friends with a lot of them
They're really shy though
They're visiting a completely different culture with a completely different language and they are naturally quite submissive so it makes sense that they are really shy
Yeah
Rich
And shy
And in good shape
fuck no
So busy at work this week
No time to Reddit :(
My M50X headset is fantastic ^^
Bespoke M50X
One of a kind
Professional modder davehamil
These headphones suck at stock
IDK why they're so popular
Have to mod the shit ouf ot them to make them any good
HOLY FUCK
OMFG
OMGGGGGGGG
OH MY FUCKING GOD
fuck I'm jealous
You may have fantastic food, but I have fantastic headphones
Gonna reign in my spending to buy a flat
not def yet
but i rly want it
Yeah and cheap
Fuck spending shitloads on rent
I would rather spend shitloads on a mortgage
Then I can build up a deposit
The mortgage will give me equity, so I can sell that 25% for £26,250 and use that as a deposit
Or buy a REALLY FUCKING NICE gaming PC
Either way, I'm sure £26,250 will bring me a lot of happiness
lmao was kidding
After £1,500 or so you don't really get any more performance
Paralel processing doesn't really improve gaming performance
It's all about clock speed
breeders?
Oh you mean pregnant women? Yeah lmao
Shared ownership places are often advertised to everyone
I found this one on Zoopla
Yeah women who make babies
Disgusting filth
Try the website of the local housing association too
People who make babies disgust me
Someone just offered me £36.50 for my Fiio E10K. Shall I take it off ebay and reserve it for you?
Yeah but CBA with fees and shit
Plus, you need an E10K with your DT770s anyway
Good sound quality makes poverty more bearable
my gf says that about my penis haha
wtf your gf says your penis is a big salad?!?!?
I chose good headphones over good food, and I don't regret my decision
HOLY FUCK OMFG
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
FUCK YOU SRSLY
I FUCKING HATE YOU
It's called jealousy, look it up m9
yeah that's true
Can't you play Dota at the resteraunt?
lmao why?
That sounds like a good idea tbh
catch up on your favourite shows whilst you wait
Otherwise your just wasting time!!!!!
Comformity is for filthy casuals

How can I make this 1mm thicker to stop it moving around? https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00C0OJ7LC/

Okay this is rly weird, when it's fully inserted I only get audio from my left ear. If I pull it out slightly, I get audio from both ears
wtf when I push my 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter in fully, I can only hear out of my right earcup. When I pull it out slightly, I can hear out of both.
IDK why it's doing this
I don't have other cans that use 2.5mm
I could try opening them up to see if there was a problem with the mod
I modded them
ffs I'm recording this fucking webinar and I fucked up at the end because aparently I called the project "test" and there was already a project with that name. and now I have to do the entire fucking take again
No
I just removed the locking mechanism which limits me to using only proprietary cables
The company that make it all use Linux, so I like them
Surely the audio should work properly when the adapter is full inserted?
And not properly when it's pulled out?
Instead of the other way around?
I don't understand why it's doing this
What about a problem with the socket? I could go in and make sure it's fixed properly and screw it in again
wtf openmailbox has a storage limit of 1GB
The cable works fine, I use them with my AKG K702s
Gmail is for NSA fags
I'd prefer if it was unlimited
The only one I can find with decent privacy and works with Thunderbird is openmailbox
And without tight restrictions
I tried Protonmail but it limits the amount of emails you can send, you have to use it inside a browser, and has a really low storage limit
And the NSA
You sound like the kind of guy who doesn't give a shit about Edward Snowons
Why does it blows?
openmailbox isn't too bad
It's just the 1GB limit that I dislike
I recommend open
Protonmail requires a stupid web browser and other restrictions
lmao just had to talk to health and safety
Because I dropped a barbell plate on my foot yesterday
She basically just told me to be more careful
Yeah luckily it was only 1.25kg
Did you break your foot?
wow 10kg
I actually still have a scar on my foot from when I stood on the edge of a dumbell years ago
Got out of bed, stood on a dumbell I left near my bed, put all my weight onto a concentrated spot, and scarred it
ffs I keep getting flamed for not getting a report done that isn't even possible in the system
I keep getting told to find a workaround
I have spoken to the support line twice and they say that they need to add it as an enhancement
I have done everyone reasonably expected of me omg
that can be reasonably expected*
We should leave Europe and join China IMO
Free movement between the UK and China would be amazing
lmao
It's a better justification to leave the EU than anything Boris Johnson can come up with
BUT IF WE LEAVE EUROPE THAN THE ENGLISH PEOPLE CAN MAKE THEIR OWN LAWS!!!!!!!!!!1
Yep can't do that in Europe because it's not compatible with the EU's silly human rights legislation!
So we must leave
The government also can't lock people up indefinitely without trial thanks to Europe!
And we can't put people who download cars or smoke joints into jail for the rest of their lives either!
Europe has too many restrictions
Me too
And go to Shanghai or something
wtf
If you want to go to Europe, you should do it before the UK leaves the EU, otherwise you won't get free movement of peoples any more
In EU you get treated equally as German citizens
People forget that free movement of people works two ways; UK people can go to Europe too
Those people are gonna be so fucked when they get deported thanks to the UK government
I fucking hate this country
It's full of filthy casuals and fat people and no hot grills
Have you considered moving to USA?
What about Samoa?
You'd love it there http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2358371/American-Samoas-battle-obesity-95-cent-nation-declared-overweight.html
95% obesity rate, perfect for you!
IDK man your view on female attractiveness is so warped that I doubt you'd value my input
?
wat
In Samoa you are considered attractive if you're fat because it means you're successful enough to buy lots of food
I don't think they've quite caught up to modern society
Yeah but you're a rich white man so they'll all want you
Like in China
They all think I am a rich white man
They all want to marry me
Does IRC and Reddit count?
As social media
What if I IM my boss, does that count
Sometimes I just IM my boss and talk about shit like the flat I want to buy and stuff
Na I should do some work now
What about Korean wife? My Korean gf says she wants to marry me
Why?
Why would I not have a good time?
She is Korean
And just get her deported if I don't like living with her?
She wants to live with me for free until/if she finds a job
Yeah I guess so
But she'd also demand a lot of my attention when I'm not at work
When I'd rather play video games
Yeah I'd want her to find a job and pay me rent and leave me alone
Yeah but most nights I want at least 2 hours of gaming
my gf keeps asking me to have sex with her without using a condom wtf
She says she won't get pregnant if I do it at specific dates
But I'm not sure if I believe her
Thanks for the advice guys
omg I fucking hate the sound of my own voice
Have to record these fucking webinars
And I sound like a fucking retard
wtfffffff
wtffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
Why do I always sound so bad in recordings
My voice sounds lovely in real life
wtf
lmao
rekt
Oh wait, does this affect caffeine too?
fuck
omg I have created the most complicated fucking flowchart for a simple process
lmao
No, just creating an RFQ
It's pretty self explanatory, you just fill out the fields with your information
But I've been asked to create a flow chart for the process
So I have to say to fill out the fields and stuff
And "click Next" a few times....
request for quotation?
got a phone call from the mortgage consultant after 25 mins on the crosstrainer
Interrupted my gym sesh :(
I was definitely sent a faulty 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter; the original cable with the headphones works fine
Yeah I have to push it in at an angle or pull it out slightly for audio to reach both earpads
I forgot that my original cables still work....
But I wanna use an adapter anyway so it'll work with my V-Moda Boompro
My headphones themselves are perfected with my mods though ^^
lemme know when you want to enter the world of Hi-Fi
Yeah mixture of mistakes and bad luck
Ground loop problem
Then the ground loop isolator didn't work
Then ordered the wrong adapter
Then the right adapter came but was broken
ffs
Also, I fucked up my headphone hooks and the adhesive is coming off my monitors now
But I passed my financial assessment and they passed it onto the housing association to make their decision whether to let me buy the flat!!!!!
But I need a fucking credit report and it's so hard omg
thx m9 but not quite there yet
btw your welcome to come visit me if you wanna do some drugs in my flat
and your welcome to bring food pls
Flat party!!!!
Gonna invite lots of Chinese grills
Where do you live?
no thx I don't want to be shot
Also, I never take my phone off silent
I don't even answer calls to my work phone
My colleague listened to my recording and said my voice is fine
She said I should have put real information in the fields instead of mashing my keyboard, which I would have done if I had some imagination and wasn't so concerned about my voice
Congratulations m9
holy fuck 30%
Yay going to view the flat tomorrow
I really need to get some mortgage arrangements
25% own, 75% rent
CHEAP rent
£130 a month
hahahahahaha
So cheap!
£52 service charge though....
Fuck service charges
I used to work in service charges and people always called us and told us how much they hated us
75% rent
What is there to figure out?
I can just google things if I don't know something
My parents and the housing association will probably tell me most things I need to know
I know how much council tax and rent and service charges are
I know approximately how much utilities and contents insurance and mortgage will cost
I know who to call if the flat is on fire
I don't know who I need to call if I have been burgled though....
Thanks, I didn't know about 111
What's 111 for?
If I'm currently being burgled, shouldn't I probably try to stop them instead of chatting on the telephone?
If I spend time on the phone, they could easily escape
What if they're there to hurt the resident though? If they didn't use enough force they could get badly hurt or even murdered
It's the burglar's choice to put themselves in danger
ffs my colleagues told my my M50X is leaking too much sound
Gonna keep my DT770s at the office as my office pair I think
They're super comfy and isolate really well
I think because they're made out of metal instead of plastic
Oh well
At least I have found a niche for my DT770s
Now I don't have to sell them
They have strengths that none of my other headphones have
And my M50X can't replace that
I'll probably use my M50X for home listening now, just because cable management is so much simpler
And I'll leave my DT770s in the office so I don't need to take them back and forth every day
Does that sound like a good plan?
Isn't the right to life more important than the right to not be injured when conducting criminal activities?
What's more important, not being robbed and murdered, or going to jail for 20 years?
s/not//
Seems like a really shitty situation either way
re the headphones?
god I have so many headphones now
Trying to fill every use case
yeah and I found out today the isolation is way better than my M50X
Isolation+comfy=office attributes
Yep, that's my AKG K702s!
I'd like a pair of Philips Fidelio X2s
Super neutral, open, great soundstage is what you want for gaming
Which is why I bought them
Gives you better detail and positioning
Can you think of any other use-cases I might need?
What if they wake up after you knock them out?
Are you allowed to beat them again?
What if they're holding a gun or knife?
What if they're really big?
What if they're Arnold Schwarznager
I hope esports never becomes mainstream http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36284379
lmfao
Well the format is quite different
Football matches rent the stadium for single events
esports tournaments take whole weekends
Or even a whole week
IDK what professional poker is
Pls can you stop being so pervy all the time?
lmao im using Visio 2003
13 year old software
"Hiya, thanks for your purchase and message, your replacement has been dispatched. Hope you get it soon :)"
Well they sent me a broken product but they made up with it by sending me a replacement without any work on my part
s/with/for/
I really like it when I don't have to send the product back to get a replacement
Too much time and effort
AOC did an on-site exchange for my computer display which was pretty good
Fan service?
srsly?
Do you ever talk about anything other than food and sex?
HEADPHONES IS A GOOD CONVERSATION CHOICE!!!!!!! ISN'T IT, RORY?
Do you like Outlaw Star? I used to watch that as a kid
My 10 year old self recommends it
IDK if it's still good because I stopped watching anime when I turned about 14
My Fiio E10K just sold for the asking price
wtf delivery will cost me £7.57
Do you have any experience with posting stuff on ebay?
Can I just take it to the post office and get it done there?
I'll probably send my Fiio E10K in its original packaging in one of those bubble envelopes like I sent the Modmic to you. Do you think that'll be okay?
I looked at that flat today, it is so nice!
IDK whether to buy this flat or move in with my brother
My brother says that although I have a "good" credit score, I won't get a mortgage unless I have an "excellent" credit score.
He says I should move in with him for 6 months and build up my credit score.
He says to be careful who to trust when taking advice, because my mother and father may not give me the best advice
I think the main problem is that living with my parents isn't good value
I'm supposed to be saving money, but I'm not saving very much living here
Defeating the entire purpose of living with my parents
I could live with my brother for £300 a month
This flat is so good value, that I'm afraid of not getting an opportunity like this again
At least I have 3 options now
Live with my mother, live with my brother, or live in this flat
If a grill lived with me and shared half the cost, the flat would be great
?!?!?!?!??
WAT
IDK maybe call the police to deal with the situation
Wouldn't that make the person inside less likely to open the door?
?????
I think Royalmail is similar, like 10-20p more
The asking price, £41.50
"buyer requested Parcelforce 48" wtf?
(Buyer selected)
Parcelforce 48
Expected delivery 19 May, 2016
IDK I'll just take it to Royalmail in the morning and ask them for the cheapest option to arrive by 19/05
Ebay says Postage cost:£7.57
I'm sure Royal Mail can do it for under £3
Myhermes is only like 10-20p cheaper, CBA for one-offs
If I was selling regularly, then sure
Yeah, but it's gonna be <£3 whether I go with RM or MH
I've never sold an item on ebay before, this is so exciting!
I was going to sell to HansProleman, but he decided he'd rather stay a low-fi pleb
IDK after charges it'll probably not be too dissimilar to the amount HansProleman was gonna pay me
HansProleman was gonna pay £30 + P&P
The difference between you, HansProleman and ebay is only a few £ anyway
yeah
Getting some ebay feedback is good for future sales thoughg
In case I need to sell any of my old shit
Like my 4690K or something
I kinda wish I bought this E10K for second-hand for cheap now
 I always avoided ebay because I thought I'd get scammed
But you can get stuff for way cheaper
Yeah
Gonna buy my next CPU and monitor second hand
I don't mind minor cosmetic damage to the fucking box
I just need the shit to work
Why?
You can often get stuff that works just as well as brand new but 20% cheaper
Depends, I'm often buying cutting-edge technology where not many people are selling second-hand
New graphics cards and monitors?
phones?
Newish flagship phones
Stuff that hasn't been on the market for >1 year is hard to get a big second-hand discount
I like the HTC 10 for it's built-in Hi-Fi DAC 
Got an HTC One M9 atm
Na, HTC phones are still pushing the boundaries
If you care about portable Hi-Fi, you should buy HTC
Yeah because you're a lowfi pleb
you disgust me
can we ban this filthy casual pls
Everything Apple makes is garbage
Made in China crap
My headphones were made in Germany and Austria
SEIG HEIL NEIN
If Hitler was alive today, he'd be using the same headphones rory and I use.
You sound like an Apple fanboytard
Apple is NOT the most technologically advanced computer maker omg
They're just really good at marketing to plebs ffs
What
You really think that German-made headphones are snake oil?!?!?!?!??!?

 I'm starting a concentrated effort to buy a flat. I have just applied for a credit card to use for petrol to boost my credit score higher than 460. I have negotiated a £3,000 reduction in my rent over the next 37.5 weeks with my mother.
I'm also speaking to a mortgage advisor on Wednesday
I can save an additional £6,000 over the next 6 months
Effectively doubling my mortgage deposit

I'm starting a concentrated effort to buy a flat. I have just applied for a credit card to use for petrol to boost my credit score higher than 460. I have negotiated a £3,000 reduction in my rent over the next 37.5 weeks with my mother. << How the fuck do you only have a credit score of 460
Because I've never had a credit card
You need to put yourself into debt to build up a credit score
If you've never proved you can repay credit, then how would you have a credit score?!?!?
Bad history can be better than none
That's why I ordered a credit card
Just gonna put petrol on it every month and pay it off
Need dat credit history
If you know you're about to die, should you spend lots of stuff on credit cards?
Go out with a bang?
Can you buy illegal things with a credit card?
Can I buy a prostitute with a credit card?
lmao just won 3v5
lmao
I sometimes play videogames instead of working
I mean if I work from home
scrub
Real men use AK
ffs customers keep calling me
Telling me they're finding dead people and shit
I don't give a fuck
I love docks
I sold my Fiio E10K for £41.50 on ebay ^^
I want to go for a poo but my manager is with me today and it will look bad if I poo for too long
Just gonna hold it in instead...
I need to go on Reddit on the toilet though
btw my Fiio E10K isn't for sale any more sry
I sold it on ebay
IDK what to do with my Beyers though. They're a great office pair because they don't leak at all
And really comfy
ATM I'm leaving them locked in my cupboard at work
I wanted to mod them so I could use them with my V-Moda Boompro, but it's too expensive
I bought my M50X for only slightly more than the mod
Then I modded my M50X
Do you ever mod your headphones?
I always mod mine
You should get some Beyer DT770 80Ohms
And a Fiio E10K
Less than a year
I decided that I want to save up enough for a flat by January
Yes
Mummy told me I can live at home for free until January, which will save me £3,000 on my rent
Because if I rent somewhere then it'll take me a lot longer than 6 months to save up
I've rented at uni before
Using student loan
Thanks
I'm going to stop buying headphones now
Sorry, I won't be able to swap my Fidelio X2s with your HD600s now
Because I need to stop buying expensive electronics for a while
I will buy Fidelio X2s after I buy a flat
But I need to save up as hard as I can right now
Not really, that's half the recommended dosage of caffeine
Can doctors get arrested for overdosing people?
My brother just moved into his new house with his new wife and new cats
And I'm still stuck living with my parents with a Korean gf in Brighton omfg
My brother has been giving me shit for living with my parents for fucking ages, then advised me against moving into this flat I just looked at lmao
I got a bit angry with him
He shouldn't have pressured me to move out
He's not advising me to stay living at home for another 6-12 months to save up more money and build up my credit score
s/not/now/
s/anowher/another/
ffs
omfg
okay that worked
ffs I need to send my wallet back to the manufacturer for repair
It's probably going to cost like 25% of the value of the item just to post it....
Unless I send it as a letter I guess?
ffs it costs £2.70 to send an item worth £10
lmfao
yay the retailer say they'll send me a new wallet without me having to return it
I'm always going to contact both the retailer and the manufacturer from now on. One of them always has better service than the other
I could even send it back to the manufacturer too and get a second wallet if I really wanted
My new 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter works great too ^^
CS:GO?
What?
Your ping is 170 in CS:GO?
Change server then
I've never had a problem other than sometimes lagspikes due to my Powerline
Set max acceptable ping to 50
lmfao this cyka https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/previews-ttv/live_user_sharishaxd-320x180.jpg
I wish GoT was broadcast in 48hz, 60hz, 120hz or 144hz
I hate this 24hz shit we've been stuck with  for over a century
Thanks, I'll read that tonight
Well that sucks
wtf
Got a link to a 60hz Hobbit torrent?
"makes it look bad" lmao
24hz looks bad
I see horrible jerky movement especially when doing a wide camera pan on 24hz
I also see 60FPS Twitch streams sometimes
Single V-Moda Boompro cable for multiple headphones ftw
Got my K702 and M50X modded to be Boompro-compatible :)
I leave the cable permanently plugged in and just plug different headphones into it
Huh?
What mod?
Do you think The International 2016 will have the highest prizepool of any esports tournament, or that Dota esports iwll be dying?
The funny thing is that people are saying that Dota will be dying if the prizepool is only $15m this year lmao
It'll still be 10X higher than any other game
http://steamcommunity.com/id/dav3th3brav3
I stopped adding them
No point if I only play CS:GO and Dota 2
I really CBA with other games any more
$2,920,703
IDK if it'll beat last year's $18,429,613
IDK if it even needs to
It's high enough already
The International 2016's prizepool
How do I make the scale logarithmic in my bar chart omfg
nvm
Got it
You forgot what logarithmic means?
It means that it increases by multiplication each time instead of increasing a linear amount
So it could go up 10X for example
1, 10, 100, 1,000, etc
Instead of 10, 20, 30, 40
Useful if you have values super far apart
Budget stuff
Maybe they won't understand it, but a chart with values as high as 64m and low as  2000 are unreadable on the same axis
My Excel skillz still sucks ass
Everyone else I work with is worse though
The only problem is that one item is 0
Which IDK how to deal with
I wish it was 1
35 items
omg she has to present this
Nobody is going to understand logarithmic scale
All the items look similar
I think it's just everything over a fixed period
ICT, legal, stationery, etc
If it's linear, only two items go higher than 5% of the vertical axis
Or just cut the vertical axis?
yeah
Well it's not really what I've been asked to do
I've been asked just to put the data into a graph
I did it and added logarithmic scale to make it more readable
I'll call my manager, explain the problem, and ask what she'd like me to do I guess
Can I add the values on the chart for the big ones, and just truncate the vertical axis to visualise the small values better?
ffs I can't get linear scale to look good
The values vary way too much
Yeah IDK whether my manager would want that
Logarithmic might just be best
It depends on who she will be presenting to I guess
Logarithmic is probably the best for values like these
$2,979,567
It needs to reach $3,527,000 by the end of today
Low FoV sucks
"thanks for working on this, the logarithmic chart below is perfect and I will use this one rather than the one with the linear scale"
Great
That solved my problem
Don't have to stress about how to visualise a graph all day now
Your eyes can only see 170 FoV
Your eyes can't see more than 170
Actually, I think it goes up to 184
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view
Yeah but usually you get VAC banned for that
It's considered cheating
And you will get banned
 wtf
They should ban people who are playing below 60fps
$3,038,448
It's increasing pretty fast
At this rate it'll go above $20m
IDK whether Valve intend it to increase every year
I don't think that's even possible
One year it'll decrease to $15m and people will be all like "omg Dota is a dead game because the prizepool is only $15m" lmao
Who is Jeremy Hunt?
Politician?
$3,098,950
$3,173,643
What headset is it?
CBA with smartphone VR
I'll wait for the real deal
wtf
wtf
stop being creepy
$3,230,276
What?
I'm forced to take all my holiday days before June :(
4 days
I already took 3 of them
Last one is tomorrow
Then I have to take one on the 2nd of June for my fucking speed awareness course too
I like to use them on Wednesdays so I only have 2 day working weeks
2 consecutive day working week
I find my Beyers don't leak as much sound as my M50X, so office colleagues don't complain
Do you ever find your Sennheisers or anything leak sound and resort to using your DT770s instead?
ATM I'm keeping my DT770s in a locked cupboard in the office permanently
So I don't have to transport them every day
I have my M50X and K702s for home
Makes cable management way easier too
So I only need a single cable for home and a single cable for work
I have my IEMs in my coat pocket and take them out for the gym
I hate my IEMs though
Less comfortable and lower sound quality
Those look extremely similar to my tips
It's more the cable around my ears too
The tips are fine actually
 "don't leak sound at all"
"at all"
You're just jealous of mine and rory's superior office headphones
I'm finding my DT770s headband adjustment is not a tactile click
It's very mushy when trying to adjust them to a specific notch
Unlike my M50X which is a very distinctive position
It has notches, I think I always go for the 4th/5th one, but because it seems a bit worn out, it doesn't always stick
I think I have an average-sized head
I'm talking about DT770s anyway
I think my M50X I have it set around 3
I love how my M50X folds up, it's so cool
The M50X has plastic backs but the DT770s has metal
So it isolates better
IEMs are best for isolation IMO
I current prediction for the TI6 prizepool is $21140003.23443516
$21,530,345
The later it gets, the more accurate my prediction will be
ATM it's $21,530,345 with a low degree of accuracy and could easily be $5m plus or minus
It's looking like it will probably be the biggest esports prize pool ever though
wow this new AoA album is really good
jowa jinjja jinjja!
$22,386,646
$22,720,858
Maybe stop playing such a shit game and play Dota instead then
Dota has prize pools over ten times as large as LoL's
I get a prize if I guess it correctly
I'm currently predicting it at $22,643,767
My prediction is going up and down
Should be more accurate before the deadline lock in 19 days
lmfao https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ_kMossOes
People can play on the same map together but have different terrain and weather effects selected, so their maps will look completely different

Dentist in 30 mins :(
yay dentist said my teeth are good
wtf
You need to go holy shit
5 years wtf
Go see one
ASAP
I thought I was really bad at only 2 years
I have a company health plan
Just got be unemployed for a week and it'll bve free
omg
Sold my item for £41.50
Paypal took like £2
Postage was £4
Ebay is £4
Only getting like £30
What?
ebay wants 10% of the value of everything I sell?
lmfao
That sucks
$5,218,257 so far, I'm predicting it'll reach $20,809,293
No
About $21m
It goes up and down
$20,887,559
It's probably going to be between $20m-$23m
Well I didn't have much data to work with, so my prediction was very unstable
The longer it goes, the more accurately I can predict it
Who are you talking to?
$20,849,605
ffs it's so hard to find time for Dota, CS:GO and soon Overwatch too....
omfg
Gonna be so busy!!!!
gf too omg
omgggggggg
Sometimes I wish I didn't have a job so I'd have time for all my gaming
I need £110,000 to £125,000 for a 1-2 bedroom house
Can't find any cheaper than that :(
There's a couple of nice ones for £125k though
I wish my document would rotate so I could work on portrait documents
ffs I'm going to have a massive fucking bill soon. I just printed out like 100 pages in colour because the printer kept outputting the pages without any ink on them
I'm going to get a disciplinary for costing the company £100 or somehting which is way above my printing quota
Even though I never actually got any fucking ink on my fucking paper
What?
They calculate how much each person costs the company with pritning
And mine is really high now even though all I got was blank pages
IDK if it's worth it
I might just do some work today instead
wtf are you talking about
Has anyone used Android Pay yet?
wtf are magstripes?
Having cards on one device is more convenient than carrying them all in your wallet
hahahahhaha
rekt
My headphones were made in Austria, where were yours?
You know you have a well-engineered product when it's made in Austria!!!!!!!
Germany I think?
Sennheiser have a lot of shit low end products though
Their mid and high end stuff is good, but their lowend stuff are crap
They're lowend
Midranged would be 598s
I've never considered purchasing a pair of Sennheiser headphones
Other headphones are better
My K702s are way better than 598s
And X2s are better than HD600s
rory cares too because he is a Sennheiser stakeholder
Yeah I think he has two Sennheiser pairs
He's way too loyal to the brand
Sennheiser is the biggest brand of any decent headphone manufacturer
Bose and Beats may be bigger brands, but they don't actually make any decent products
Beyerdynamic, Philips, and AKG produce better headphones than Sennheiser anyway
Beats are the biggest headphones brand in the world now
They just took lots of famous pop artists and put them into commercials and now they have a massive brand
Some people are saying the Solo 2 Beats headphones are decent though
I think M50X are the most stylish
They fold up so cool!
I wish all headphones were designed so well
wtf
My headphones aren't
I like how my DT770s are solid pieces of metal covering my ears
Why don't you like the M50X?
They have a removable cable and fold up!!!!
I can't even use my Boompro cable with my DT770s!!!!
X2s are better than HD600s
wtf?
Why?
HD800s are overpriced
All headphones are good if you price them low enough
I'd buy Beats if they were only £5
Because that's how much they're worth
Some people say the Beats Solo 2 are actually decent
Sennheiser do make a lot of shit lowend products
Well I'm not impressed with my Shure SE215 IEMs
I have
FUCK SAKE THIS SHITTY 13 YEAR OLD VERSION OF VISIO DIDN'T SAVE MY WORK PROPERLY
HAVE TO REDO IT BECAUSE IT'S SHIT SOFTWARE
Has anyone else listened to the new AOA album yet? It's fucking incredible

lmao Mr Scruff is pre-installed on our work laptops
7
I have no respect for sellouts like Mr Scruff and Jack Black
that sounds so boring
I don't do drugs because it affects my gaming performance and I am trying to save up for a flat or a house
The Daily Mail is for plebs
I need to get a bigger salary so that a mortgage supplier will lend me one 4X my salary
Because ATM 125k-4X my salary = a deposit required of £48,240
I need to save up £48,240 or get a bigger salary....
smoking weed is not a marketable skill omfg
I met a man who worked at Sainsbury's who had a mortgage wtf
IDK how
lmao why not?
I put my Dota and CS:GO mmrs on my CV
What?
lmao
give me an interview pls
KD ratio isn't an important statistic
Only silvers think that
HOLY SHIT £Competitive + benefits
holy shit I could borrow £120k which would give me money to buy a house!!!!!
wtf our new Expenses Procuredure is such BS. "Standard routes should be included in the claim form" but the standard route is 27 miles and I can't find a route on Google Maps for anywhere near that few miles
27 miles my ass
My company is ripping off our employees
Underpaying our mileage claims
Well not mine because I always claim more than 27 miles because I'm not an idiot
"If a longer route is taken
then please explain this in the comments section of the form."
Maybe because it takes less time?
"The shortest route available should be used"
They aren't very clear on this
So ambigous!
hahahaha would be so funny if I applied for that job and then we worked together
"Linux, and Bash scripting coupled with some
network design skills" I know some of that stuff!
"Have experience of system administration, automation of system configuration, and
debugging" some of that too
FUCK
If what were the case?
wtf why?
Surely you have to not discriminate and hire the best person for the job?
Gender discrimination is illegal
You should probably report your HR department to Ofcom or something
What?
Your HR department aren't allowed to discriminate on sex or race or religion or disability
Because they are protected characteristics
I don't think Satanism is a legally recognised religion?
I never bothered applying for jobs because I hate the application process so much
Why is that?
I CBA to write a cover letter 100 times
God I'd hate to work at Tesco for 5 years
I got fed up of Sainsbury's after 3 months
Yeah but it's hard
It's so hard to do 50 items a minute or whatever the ridiculous target is
They told me I was too slow or some shit
No, I was shelfstacking
There are a hundred million different products in the store, and IDK where the fuck they all are
I was too exhausted of 10 hour nightshifts and barely any sleep in the day to continue after 3 months
My fucking nephew and dogs and parents wouldn't shut the fuck up in the day
So I was sleep-deprived over 3 months
I almost died from exhaustion
Then I couldn't find a job afterwards because even Sainsbury's didn't want me
And my mother gave me so much abuse for being unemployed
Then a job agency put me in a job cleaning old peoples' toilet chairs *shudder*
God it was horrible
Had lots of poopchairs come in full of shit
Why?
My gf is Korean
I just wear whatever I get given for my birthdays and Christmases
I've literally never bought my own clothes in my life
I get gifted enough
Do I need to do a P87 form every year?
IDK
lmao why did HR tell you to hire the grill?
I bet she sucks at CS
I wish Spotify had a better duplicates-detector for playlists
Because ATM it's not catching most duplicates
omg
Vulkan support is being added to Dota 2 -- probably sometime NEXT WEEK. The following depots have been added.
Windows 64 Bit.
Linux 64 Bit.
From Fletcher @ Valve
We're going to release vulkan support soon, probably sometime next week.
I can't fucking wait to try out Vulkan next week in my favourite game
NSFW FFS
Is that Australian guy still pretending to be the creator of Bitcoin?
wtf why couldn't I sleep last night now I feel tired and shit
Does 13:00 count as before midnight?
hahahahaha Windoze always sets the clock wrong by 1 hour when booting into it from Linux wtf
I wish terrorist attacks and aeroplane accidents would stop happening
wtf
wtf is wrong with you srsly
Is it safe to buy CPUs and GPUs on ebay? What do you do if they don't work? Just lose hundreds of £££?
So what's stopping someone from getting a free graphics card of it?
I hope I described my item condition accurately
Item condition:Used
Nothing is wrong with it though
Well there's no real visible wear, other than maybe a tiny bit of dust
The thing was just sitting on my desk for around 8 months
I try to look after my expensive electronics
hahhaahha my friend has finally learnt how shit his gaming headsets are and is considering purchasing a Philips Fidelio X2, V-Moda Boompro, and Creative E5
I hope my Overwatch arrives today
I'll be pissed if it doesn't
If it doesn't arrive today, I'm never going to buy a boxed game copy ever again
Have you bought Overwatch yet?
wtf
who is tony montana?
Is he related to Miley Cyrus?
I haven't seen a lot of old films
I've seen London Has Fallen though
wtf
There's no way I'm clicking on that
AOA's new album is fantastic
Anyeoung rory
What? When?
Sorry I can't, I'm going to Brighton this weekend.
What about chest pain?
No because your creepy
How do I find duplicates, but not remove them?
nvm
IDK why I bother asking when I can just google shit
WHAT THE FUCK
OVERWATCH LAUNCHES TONIGHT AND FUCKING GAME HASN'T SHIPPED ME MY KEY YET
I'M NEVER USING THESE STUPID INCOMPOTENT TWATS AGAIN OMFG
Game
lmfao
"
Hi Samuel 
Good news! Your order will be on its way to you very soon. We're just packing it at the moment and will email you again when it's shipped." - 4 days ago
So
Never received another email
Launch is tonight
They haven't even shipped it yet
Fucking pathetic
lmao your on m9
im on hold
they're probably busy answering phone calls from Overwatch customers
I hope they answer before they close ffs
I want my fucking product key
"we're really sorry to keep you waiting, shouldn't be too much longer now"
Did you buy Overwatch too?
wtf
"if you're a fan of Facebook, search for game.co.uk and like our page"
lmfao
Who do they think I am
I'm no facebooktard
your rich, just buy the game
Oh there's a chat too
Gonna do that
And phone
Someone will get to me
Either phone or live chat
Thanks for hanging in there your position in the queue is currently 12.
Yeah it sucks
Good thing I didn't commit too much time
He can?
Thanks for hanging in there your position in the queue is currently 9.
Answer the fucking phone omg
Been on the phone for 20 mins now
I'm at work
Can't watch youtube ivdeos
ditto
And my phone call
yes
ffs doesn't sound like they have a key for me
Might have to wait for the box to arrive
ffs
It's in the box
I have to wait for the box
The box won't come until tomorrow at the earliest
Can't play when the game launches
I'm so glad I didn't take the day off tomorrow
I'd have to drive into work to pick it up
Na, more like Dota
Yeah mobas suck, CBA to ever play one
I'm just playing Dota and CS:GO atm
Fuck dailies, that shit turned me off Hearthstone
It's just designed to force you into a grind until you get fed up and pay them
I'm done with games which are designed around grinding
I want all gameplay content available immediately
I don't mind if you find/earn cosmetics though
That can be fun when you randomly find an interesting hat
But if they lock gameplay stuff behind a paywall, it makes the game less fun
No
no I have a life
"
Hi Samuel 
We've shipped your order! It should be with you very soon."
It had better fucking arrive tomorrow
Free Delivery - 1st Class Post (1-2 working days)
fuck sake
It might not arrive until Wednesday, and I'm going to a conference then
So if it doesn't arrive tomorrow, I won't have it until Thursday evening omfg
omg if my game doesn't arrive today then I won't have it until Thursday
Why the fuck did they not sent it to me 2 weeks ago?
This retailer is fucking shit
I used the legit Blizzard partner
I have a busy week and I can't play this weekend because I have to go visit my gf in Brighton :(
wtf the box price is really high
30 is a lot
CS:GO is like £5
Around £12?
Yeah but it's on sale so often that you can get keys easily for £5 any time of year
I spend it on upgrading my PC
Framerate>pretty skins
Na, gotta save for a house now
I'm not going to buy ANYTHING from now on
I need all the money I can get
I'm still struggling to find time for both Dota 2 and CS:GO :(
wtf
Yeah but he's "unelectable" because he's too old or some shit
To be PM you must be in the strict age bracket of 40-60
I only vote for kpop girls
wtf is snooper's charter
wtf
Even if I use VPN or TOR?
Don't they get caught by Royal Mail sniffer dogs?
I don't do drugs
But I am not a professional :(
ffs I can't rent anywhere because everyone only wants professionals wtf
I have a job
I'm just not a professional
I don't do drugs because I have a gf and a gaming PC and soon a house
Your gaming PC is probably low-end shit though
You don't even have decent headphones
What framerate do you get in CS:GO?
Filthy casual
Only noobs play at 200fps
Real men play at 400
What are your PC's specs
That joke is so old
wtf that's fine
You just need to lower your graphics to minimum
Yeah probably because you have all the graphics turned up on your weak GPU
What?
????????
What does your gf think about your drug addiction?
wtf
That's so bad for your lungs
wtf you can do that now?
It's bad for your gaming skill and driving too
wtf
filthy casual
Can you buy legal drugs on the same websites as illegal?
Legal highs
Not criminalised stuff
Because then I can ask where I can buy legal highs and then find the illegal stuff too without asking for it and breaking channel rules
What email providers does everyone use?
I could just keep using my uni one if I wanted to
What's the difference between csv and xls?
My company uses all microshit products
A lot of our internal websites only work with Internet Explorer
Cryengine is open source now?
What email provider do you use?
I love openmailbox, it's so much better than gmail and hotmail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-a8lPAphSE
dude you sound like such a racist
You wish your gf was a sexy Korean
wow racist and a sexist?
Have you completed the CS:GO co-op operation yet?
wtf
But you're missing out on the story
The story missions are actually quite cool
Maybe, I don't care about the scores
What are the scores even for?
I just wanted the gold badge
I care more about being a good player and pwning noobs like Iota rather than arbitrary scores on co-op missions
wanna play Overwatch with me and Bulwark?
If my copy hasn't arrived by 16:00 I'm going to call Game and complain
Because they could have sent it to me two weeks ago ffs
IDK I'll probably just tell them that they needlessly inconvenienced me by making my product arrive late and that I'll just get my games through digital distribution from now on
Because I won't be using Game again if they can't even get my product to me on time
The game launched over 12 hours ago and I still don't have my copy
Yeah, they told me that the product code is inside the box, so they can't even email it to me either
So the product code is stuck inside the box that they didn't even post until like 6 hours before the launch
They're so incompotent
I'm going to tell Game that they need to compensate me for the days I've taken off work to play the game
I like Iota today, he's actually being really cool
I don't earn much :(
Like £55 maybe
Damn that's a good idea
Dell has been selling Ubuntu laptops for like a decade now
It's good that you don't have to pay the Windoze tax
lmfao that video
That girl is fucking stupid
The news presenters are just as retarded though
What a hassle!
TV news is the worse
hahahahhahaha nice
Yeah but the game won't arrive later than tomorrow probably
Hmmm yeah so yesterday, today and most of tomorrow....
So Game owes me £750
Nice.
"We aim to get pre-orders with you in time for launch day, however we canâ€™t control courier delays"
Well it's been 12 hours and I still don't have it
I'm going to tell Game that they're stupid retarded cunts and that I'll be buying from G2A from now on
I have doubts they'll compensate me at all
They probably won't even compensate me the price of the game
Can't, already used the beta codes
And it's already been posted to me
That's why I bought from Game, to get the beta codes
I gave mine to my friend for free without owing any favours
Because I am a nice guy
And I knew he'd love the game
And now he wants to buy 144hz monitor and proper headphones to enjoy the game more

Dota 2 has Vulkan now
wtf why are people sending me a PDF document one page at a time
Why can't they just put all the pages into the PDF wtf
over 14 hours ago
AND WHERE THE FUCK IS MY KEY
ffs I hate it when someone asks me to do something on Excel on their PC and they have a shitload of acceleration on their mouse and their PC is slow to respond
No wonder everyone takes so long to do anything
My own work PC is bad enough
I'm using my old Steelseries mousepad for my work PC
Might upgrade my mouse and bring my Logitech G400s in too
It doesn't matter too much for office use
It's mostly to reduce friction and mouse feet degrading when playing FPS games
Or to make it more consistent
Nice display arms, I have my displays sitting on top of two reams of paper each
http://steamcommunity.com/id/dav3th3brav3
What? It's plenty
32 won't increase your FPS
16 is all I need right now
That won't increase FPS
The game is loaded into memory anyway
I've tested it, it makes no difference
That's what loading screens are for
Only a very badly designed game wouldn't load the map during the loading screen
Anyeoung rory
I finally got Overwatch yesterday
But now I need to go visit my gf ffs
FUCK
And she'll make me stay for the bank holiday too
And her libido is too high and it's annoying
hahahahhaha nice
I might use that last image as my Steam avatar
I'm getting bored of being called an anime weeb
I don't even watch anime
Is K-on about kpop?
Heroes never die
What is dead may never die
Anime is for nerds and children
How does it feel to know that you watch a TV cartoon specifically made for Japanese children?
Insurance for what?
wtf
Why so high?
My entire car was only £270 and that was with 0 no claims
wtfffffffff for a moped?!?!?
wtf that's way less than my car is worth
wtf
Oh right
My first year of insurance was like £2,000
Kinda
Depends what you mean by "driving"
wtf is a 125
Yeah I got it when I was 17
I used it to buy alcohol
They asked for ID, I gave them my ID which clearly said I was 17, but they still sold to me 90% of the time wtf
Yeah that was the plan
It only failed a couple of times
And worked hundreds of times
Filthy casual
If you don't drink, then why aren't you Global Elite?
There's an inverse correlation between alcohol consumption and mmr
The drunker you get, the shitter you play
wtf are you talking about????
omg
Are you living under a rock?
Not since yesterday
What mousemat did you get?
wtf is that thing?
IDK what brand that is
Zowie makes the best mousemats
haha I was considering getting a deskmat
Not much space on desk?
Your mouse feet must hate you
I got a new Zowie GTF-X recently
The Zowie GTF-X is the lowest friction mousemat on the market
Your aim must be really bad
You have no space to move your mouse around
What rank are you?
wtf why is your desk so tiny
And why two keyboards wtf
You need a bigger desk
I have a big desk so I'm not so horribly cramped
Move out of where?
wtf you still live with your parents?
why?
I want this desk https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00IS26EFC/
And I'm not even telling you the NSFW things! If I was not at work, then the box would be even tinier because of racism and stuff!
wtf why you kick m
s/m/me/
I am at work and doing work things too
Why haven't you moved out yet? Are you saving up to buy?
omg I checked my bank accounts last night and I have £7,500
I could build the most amazing gaming PC ever
lmao my company is always trying to get my to claim less miles than I actually drove
They create 'standard journeys' which are less miles than the shortest possible route
I ignore the 'standard journeys' and just calculate the number of miles myself
If they challenge my miles, I will tell them that their standard journey miles are wrong and ask them to prove it's only 27 miles
Because it's NOT 27 miles
omfg
The shortest possible route is 29 miles, and that's not the fastest one
Why not?
I probably wouldn't be ready to move out yet either if I didn't have a gf. I'm going to move out soon so that I am allowed to have girls round
I like having a massive disposable income and having my laundry done for me
Is the maximum commute length you would do?
Does anyone else here use Microsoft Outlook for work purposes?
Do you use 'tasks'?
I was always told just to litter my calendar with lots of random stuff
With TV releases?
I've imported Chinese and Korean holidays
My calendar is really sparsely populated now because I have so many tasks but not many meetings
So I look like I am not busy
Did you know that DT770s are the headphones use by Radio 1?
With a pedigree in studio and live recording, Beyerdynamic is the number one choice at the BBC - check out photos on the BBC Radio 1 website and you will see most guests wearing the DT770.
proof http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03wbcn5
What variant are they?
Hard to tell
It was the first one I found on the Radio 1 website
why do radio people always look so weird
What variant are they?
Why do you think Radio 1 uses DT770s?
Do you think for the good sound quality and isolation?
I am doing work
I wish I had a pair of DT770s with a removable 3.5mm cable
What headphones do you use?
I like the isolation and comfort, sound quality and isolation of my DT770 Pro 80Ohm headphones, but hate the cable and want a removable cable so I can use my V-Moda Boompro. Can I buy DT770s with a removable cable, or is there another pair of headphones that would be ideal for me?
I bet they sound like shit
I only wear Hi-Fi
Except my Shure SE215s, I'm not sure if I would class them as Hi-Fi
You can still have Hi-Fi mono I guess?
Does Spotify have an option for mono headphones?
Damn that sucks
What happened to your ear?
wtf
That's gay
No, and I can't find them on sale anywhere either
Yeah I know but I am upset that I can only use my DT770s in the office now
My M50X doesn't have the isolation and soundstage and comfort and sound quality that my DT770s do
It was 32bit before I think?
fuck I got my phone's speaker wet and now it doesn't play sound
It puts me off getting the HTC 10 and it's non-waterproof speakers and getting the Samsung S7 instead
But the HTC 10 has a much nicer metal design and close-to-stock Android and amazing DAC....
ffs if the HTC 10 was waterproof I'd definitely buy it, but I'm worried now
Holy shit I want that fucking omelette
What phone will you buy, HTC 10 or Samsung S7?
Both look good
I just wish the HTC had some fucking waterproofing omg!!!!!!!!!!1
Yeah okay I'll keep my M9 then
Will you get the S8 or HTC 11?
Your S6 is not waterproof AFAIK, right?
Will you upgrade to the S7 if your S6 gets waterdamaged?
Yes
Has been for a while now
haha and all my work gives me is a crappy Nokia
I hate this phone
Overwatch is really fun
Have you bought it yet?
wtf is "samsung bullshit layer"?
Let me know when you've bought it pls
HTC 10 is close to stock
Yeah it's expensive
Yeah but Chinese phones have shit DACs

SG553 wtf

What rank are you?
I remember years ago when my console peasant friends would talk about their CoD KD:R like it was their skill rank
I want to buy an Ncase M1 + Corsair H100i but I am saving for a house......
I also want to buy a GTX 1080 but I am saving for a house.....
That joke wasn't funny the first time
The difference between a GTX 1080 and an Xbox One is enormous
I might hold off buying the 1080 and wait for Polaris and 1080TI
Or just save up for a house instead
My grandparents are going to vote to leave the EU, but IDK why they deserve to vote since they just sit in their house all day every day and probably won't even be alive before the UK actually finishes leaving
Agreed
They voted to join the EU and now they want to vote to leave wtf?
Yeah my mum reads the Daily Mail
She emails me Daily Mail articles every week
I never read them
Well yeah, people always say that we get control of our country again if we leave the EU, but do we actually? We'll still be ruled by the same shitty government
Party politics is just the worse
IDK it's just the sort of thing that the anti-EU people are saying nowadays
The migrants or the refugees?
I would like to live in Germany
Too bad I can't speak German
I think I'll need more than three
Fucking hell Starbucks venti mocha is nice
wtf yes you can
More like £3.70
Yeah I only buy it when my gf wants it
I'd rather put £3.70 towards a GTX 1080
Why not 970?
wow you can buy a 970 for £160 now http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_sacat=0&_mPrRngCbx=1&_udlo=100&_udhi=&LH_BIN=1&_nkw=gtx+970&_sop=15
I just want to boost my framerate
Because I'm only getting about 150-200 in Overwatch right now
Why do you need more than 16GB?
Why do you need multiple virtual machines?
When I bought 16GB in 2015 I thought it was a bit overkill
It still is I guess
I don't see myself needing more than 16GB for at least a few years
wow RAM is cheap as fuck now https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/parts/memory/#sort=a7&page=1&qq=1
£85.98 for 32GB of DDR4 wow
Isn't that ridiculously overkill though?
Even 16GB is so overkill
Why is RAM so cheap?
As a fraction of my gaming PC's total cost, it's getting very small now
£48 of RAM is more than enough
wtf
16GB is enough omg
There's a good way about Steve Jobs?
ffs I should probably keep living with my parents for another 12 months so I can save up for a house, but my gf wants me to buy one in 6 months
My gf is going to cost me so much
No
I asked her for £200 to cover food and bills and stuff and she said that's going to be too much
IDK sex?
She's Korean though...
wtf is a fwb
I'm also being pressured to get married because my brother and sister are getting married
25 this year
Yeah but you don't live with your parents
I can save more money living at home!
That last one is a probability
£350
Maybe there will be fewer once the UK leaves the EU?
How do people get away with selling that shit?
But amps and dacs and headphones are good, right?
I didn't waste my money on my K702s+Creative E5 I hope?
wtf is the difference?
What? Apt-get is only for distros based on Debian
That's one of many programs
What distro do you use?
12.04 wtf
Get 16.04 desktop
Why server?!?!?
What are your remote servers for?!?!??
Does WhatsApp Desktop support phone calls?
I want to get rid of shitty Skype
Damn that sucks
What do you use their web UI for?
"Linux Steam library"
Yeah too bad I want to play fucking Overwatch
https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=17145
wow the Overwatch subreddit is already bigger than the Dota one
Anyeoung rory
I really think my DT770s are the perfect office headphones
Wayyyyyyyy better isolation than my M50X
I might get a second pair of DT770s with a removable cable for home use
Because my M50X doesn't block out the sound of my mum's annoying little dog as much as I'd like
And my SE215s aren't comfy or Hi-Fi enough for home use
IDK what to do with my old Corsair Vengeance 1500 7.1 gaming headset. I might just throw them away
Why would you want them?
Get some decent headphones m9
I could send it to you if you cover my costs
postage, packaging, etc
My colleague asked me which side I was voting for, I told her I won't vote, and she said I am "childish" for not voting
IDK making a single vote doesn't seem very influential to me
If I had 100 votes, then maybe I'd use them
I don't think for everyone
I'll moan only if we end up leaving by 1 vote
Deposit for a house?
Me neither
I'm saving up
But my gf might have to leave the country by then!!!!!!
My gf wants to live with me
She wants to get married
no
Is anyone else here a higher rank than silver?
lmao someone just phoned me and told me they "don't do computers"
I ignored that comment and solved their problem
They forgot their password and our password reset function isn't working
So I did it manually
thanks m9
What's the difference between Elijah Wood and Daniel Radcliffe?
Are you talking about Elijah Wood?
Daniel Radcliffe can't act?
I'll take your word for it, I haven't seen him in anything before
ffs if I marry my gf she'll get like £20,000 worth of property from me and I'll get nothing from her
I'll still be struggling just as much to pay off a mortgage on a one bedroom flat
There's a mega hype Dota tournament on right now btw
You don't need to play Dota to watch it
Dota has a shitload of viewers that don't even play the game
Dota came first
And it's nothing like LoL
TLDR?
How do I filter out non-Asians from my Tinder search?
"transgender-friendly feature" is ambiguous ass fuck
How do I contact someone whose email address I do not know?
What if I don't know their phone number or postal address?
He's my friend's brother and an officer in the armed forces, so I need him to be my personal reference for work
I have a name and name of an employer and his brothers' contact information
His brother told me he doesn't know his email address
Does it matter if he wants to be?
Source on the 7m?
LoL playerbase is also super casual and can easily move onto the next big casual game
So 7 million sales then
It's fractured though, lots of people on consoles
Overwatch has a serious problem where you only need to win one teamfight to capture a point
You hoard your ultimates, then use them to win the teamfight, take over the point, then you win
There's no buybacks or glyphs or anything to delay them
So you lose
If McCree uses high noon, the enemy can just kill him before he finishes channeling
7 seconds is enough to capture the point
I went to a speed awareness course last night
I sped there and sped home lmao
Holy shit this production value is insane
I'm not clicking on that
how the fuck would you know

none of it is likely to result in serious injury
omg your so creepy
wow the weight difference must have been massive
I am always worried that my gf is secretly trying to get pregnant
wtf why would you want to
>200lbs is seriously dangerous and unhealthy
Remember, the more you weigh the faster you'll die
wat
wtf
Factors unrelated to their weight
That's why I don't do drugs
I might start doing adderall
My work pc has teamviewer
wtf it is?
Source?
wtf there's no such thing
hahaha yeah that's why I stopped drinking those kind of drinks
I like the "people near me" feature in Wechat
Way better than shitty Tinder
Can you use Windoze as a command-line OS like Linux?
lmfao Anita Sarkeesian
She's the biggest troll in gaming journalism
What is the appropriate response to an office grill that clearly fancies me says "have a nice weekend"?
I said "thank you" but do I have to tell her to have a nice weekend too?
LMFAO feminists are fucking stupid http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/36441870/choking-x-men-apocalypse-poster-is-criticised-by-actress-rose-mcgowan

lmao but it's so funny how stupid some people can be
I just watched this anime review https://youtu.be/r80kSTVoPUY

rory Happy Memorial Day
ffs my shoelaces are too tight and it's cutting off the circulation to my foot
Or Helium 3 on the moon
wow I just took my shoes off and looked at my feet and they had massive marks where my shoes were digging into my feet
I have loosened the laces by a shitload to give my feet some relief
Am I allowed to wear those at work?
He should use Keepass or Lastpass
I only use randomly generated passwords for every account now
But if my Lastpass gets hacked I will be so fucked
How do I know if my gf is a catfish?
What do you mean?
How do I know if my gf is a catfish?
I use openmailbox.org
openmailbox is the best
ffs I'm asleep and working during the entire Manila Major
Can't wait for The International so I can actually watch most of the event
Stupid timezones
Stupid work and sleep
I wish I never had to work or sleep
I'd have so much time for gaming and ignoring my gf
ffs when I get married I'll have to give away half my house but still have a massive debt
It would put me instantly into negative equity!!!!!
?
But what does it actually do?
wtf
How does it cure depression and cancer with magic waves?
Who the fuck is Noel Edmunds?
Isn't Deal or No Deal that really really dumbed down quiz show?
In fact, it's so dumbed down that they removed the requirement to know anything by removing the questions
God it's awful
Amazing how many old people watch that shit
Old people really need to get a life
I was unemployed and I never watched shit like that
I just slept and played Dota
And Diablo
Diablo is good if you're unemployed
It wastes a shitload of your time
I don't play any more though, I don't have time and CBA with the power treadmill
They reset progresses every few months by increasing the level cap or some shit
Yes they raise the level cap, then raise the gear cap, then increase paragon XP rate, etc
It's effectively a new power treadmill every few months
I always steal the leftover catering food after board meetings
I love it
Is it possible to use my phone as my laptop's DAC through USB?
rory:
wtf I can hear ringing
When it's quiet
Do you know thorin?
Thorin Duncan Shields
I had to call an ambulance for my grandmother last night
Transmission is the best IMO
She got really drunk because it was her birthday, then fell over and took most of the skin off her forearm
Old people have skin like paper
I was worried because last time she fell she broke her hip
She has osteoporosis
I like my Korean gf's skin
What does CP stand for?
wtf
You're weird
I like Transmission because it lets me set the upload limit to 0

It's high noon
yay my credit card is all set up now
I can go buy shit
Petrol or a pizza probably
I was thinking about buying my pizza with it last night, but my bank account didn't confirm my direct debit was set up, so I played it safe
It's annoying though, because I can't get my TSB 5% contactless cashback with my credit card
So I'm losing money to try and boost my credit score
Which sucks ass
But it's the only way I can really boost my credit score properly I think.....
So I need to do it
If I get a really good credit score then I can get a cheap mortgage and maybe 0% car finance on my next car!!!!
Maybe I could even get 0% finance on my next phone?
Do you think I could get 0% finance on a GTX 1080 if I buy it from Amazon?
Free borrowing is the best kind of borrowing
When you buy shit using Paypal?
I might use Paypal to buy an Ncase M1 at some point
And I might use ebay to buy Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro and Philips Fidelio X2
Oh btw my friend is gonna buy Philips Fidelio X2 and Creative E5 soon
wtf stupid touchpad is positioned so closely to the keyboard and it made me change page
Fuck touchpads fucking useless invention
I'm gonna skip the firstgen
I think I downloaded like 100k of my uni emails one time
Was mistake, I was only trying to download mine
Had to shut it down before I got arrested
I can't remember how I did it
Yeah but also it was slowing down my computer
Downloading thousands of emails isn't quick
IDK how I accidentally downloading >100k uni emails instead of my own inbox
Is that a good thing?
The main thing stopping me from using Linux full-time right now is lack of Overwatch support
How the fuck am I supposed to wreck scrubs and pwn noobs in Overwatch if the game won't even run?!?!?!??!?!
ffs Blizzard get your fucking act together
It's only a matter of time before CS:GO gets Vulkan and Source 2 too
They're probably already working on it
My grandmother is in hospital
All the skin fell off her arm, it was disgusting
I don't know
Holy shit the Manila Major has some insane production value
I'm thinking of buying the Ncase M1, I really need better cooling for my PC
I don't have the space on my desk for the case though....
My dual displays+mousepad take up pretty much the entire space on my desk
Maybe I could get some display arms so I can put one of the displays above my mousepad instead
2016-06-10 10:48:12 +rory <+davehamil> â•¡ All the skin fell off her arm
she fell over
and her skin fell off
Yeah I think so
wtf why did you go to Minks
wtf
I wish my company would send me to Seoul
No
I aborted after "midget google images"
I was worried where this was going
What do you think about Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro?
It could be my DT770s with removable cable
Instead of getting them modded
My headphones were made in Germany, where were yours made?
Apart from Dota
Dota 2 probably takes the title as the greatest game ever made
Don't be an idiot pls
What's so bad about 'flights philippines'?
ah right
Or maybe they just wanted to go to the Manila Major?
The isolation of my ATH-M50X aren't really good enough
My DT770s are wayyyyyyyy better
But my DT770s don't have the removable cable that I need
So IDK what I'll get next, maybe Beyer Custom One Pros?
I want a removable cable and good isolation with great comfort and sound quality
So basically the DT770s but with a removable cable
To plug them into my V-Moda Boompro
fixmyheadphones.co.uk quoted me £70 to do the removable cable mod
Don't have space for a Blue Yeti
It does the job for gaming
A closer mic is also better for noisy rooms
wat?
What about headphone sound?
Don't BOSE have the best ANC?
I find that my DT770s isolate good enough for the office
And I have my SE215s if I really need them and also for the gym
I'm not a fan of ANC, CBA with the inferior sound quality and batteries
Are there any other websites that could give me a quote to add a removable cable to my DT770s?
Or another pair of headphones that would suit my needs?
rory:
"downvoted by americans" wtf?
wat
I'll check these out http://headphones.specout.com/d/f/Detachable-Cable
The fucking annoying thing is that since I'm leaving my DT770s in the office and using my M50X as my home closed pair, the M50X has shit isolation, and I can hear my mum's stupid dog barking
rekt
Stupid LoL retard
True Linux masterraces play Dota and not shitty LoL
ffs I want a coffee but I CBA to make everyone else too
else one too
But then I am breaking etiquette!!!!!!
wow I wish we had that here
I'm always so fucking thirsty
What is the difference between Elijah Wood and Daniel Radcliffe?
What?
What's similar?

Oh the people
Yeah
wtf there's a new Quake?
holy shit
I love Quake
LawBreakers looks shit
I'm pretty disappointed with my M50X
IDK why these headphones are so popular
Have you ever compared them to DT770s?
You can get faulty headphones on ebay which only play out of one channel for like 20% of the original value
It would cost more than buying two faulty ones
My DT770s are so much better than my M50X wtf
?
My HTC One M9 has a really nice headphone output
I water damaged the speaker, and I would buy an HTC 10, but I want something waterproof for my next phone
Do you still use an external AMPDAC with your phone?
Oh wow my IEMs sound like crap
I really love the portability of my IEMs, but the sound is just nowhere near as good as my K702s or DT770s
I have before
But yeah, not really practical
wtf?
What do you mean?
Why sunglasses?
You can do that without sunglasses just as easily
My M50X has shit isolation compared to my DT770s
I can hear the dog barking at home, and my colleagues complained about the sound leakage
But with my DT770s, I can listen at max volume no problem
DT770s are way more comfortable too, even after modding the comfort of my M50X
And they have a larger soundstage and better sound quality and larger drivers
The only thing my M50X are good at is that they can fold up and I can remove the cable
If my DT770s could fold up and had a removeable cable they'd be perfect
hahahaha did you see Hodor at the Manila Major?
Hodor is one of the characters in GoT

wtf is K-on
I've noticed that Spotify's kpop library has improved a lot recently
Who is your favourite Overwatch hero?
Who here plays Overwatch?
?
Who is your favourite Overwatch hero?
Do you mean personally or for gameplay?
I personally like D.va the most because she's a sexy Korean, but I play Widowmaker the most because she's OP as fuck
It's pretty accurate despite the horrendous fucking input lag this game has
I had to lower all my graphics to minimum just to get 200+ FPS
I never pay attention to accuracy stats
If you pre-fire or just spam shots in spawn room or to destroy the environment then it reduces it
Yeah but also you get way less input lag with lower graphics
Widowmaker is so fucking OP
IDK what Blizzard were thinking
"let's give one hero the ability to oneshot half the other heroes from super long range and also give her a really strong close-range rifle, a grappling hook for amazing mobility, and wallhacks
"
I hate it, it doesn't go where I am it
Reaper's fucking teleport skill has a weird autoaim too
I might upgrade my case and CPU cooler so I can OC my CPU and get more FPS
I will wait until after I've paid my car insurance and MoT and service first
Because that's going to leave me broke
ffs there's too much small talk in my office
I usually just ignore people unless they ask me a question or say something that requires a response
hahahahaha apparently everyone here thinks I am free to talk when I have my headphones on
Sometimes I wear my headphones without plugging them in to try to stop them
But it doesn't work!!!!!!!
I'd rather they just type to me in Lync
Then I don't have to stop listening to my music
How did I add my company email and Lync to my personal phone and PC?
I don't have space on my desk at home to use my work laptop and my PC
How do I know if we use office 365?
I use my .ac.uk email to get £5 Spotify
 How do I find out my email password?
There's a .local/owa address
Can't find anything on the intranet
They allowed it for my colleague's phone because she never got a work phone
I do
No I have a work mobile
My work mobile is a pain in the ass to keep charged
And I CBA to boot up my work laptop just to check my emails and Lync
Can I install f.lux on a company laptop?
I mean will it get me fired and arrested and fined and possibly jailed?
I don't want to go bankrupt from copyright infringement when IT checks in 6 months

phew I fixed it just before my colleague logged on
Literally 30 seconds before
Took me like an hour
Close call
She told me I need to do stuff in the test system
And not make changes to the live
The test system is a piece of shit
It's not a mirror of the live system
yes
Broke something important
Had to fix it
We have no way to backup because that would be too useful
We don't even host the servers
It's external
It's managed by someone else
IDK maybe the company that hosts the system makes backups

Get the sugar free one
Those energy drinks have so much sugar in them
The tropical one is fucking nice though
I used to buy them all the time
Now I only drink sugar free at weekends and coffee the rest of the week
I'd drink sugar free all the time, but the citric acid is bad for my teeth
So I only drink the citric acid at weekends now
Or days I'm not at work
I don't have any coffee at home
So I just drink sugar-free energy drinks instead
There's a song I really like about Sugar Free https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_eo5j5sib8
I like to listen to it whilst downing a Sugar Free Relentless
I'm going to get a 240hz monitor soon
Yeah because everyone knows the human eye can only see 144fps /s
I'd love a 500hz gsync/freesync/async monitor so I can have a synced refresh rate without having to lower my FPS
The problem right now is that these adaptive sync monitors are too low refresh rate and you can't make use of them properly unless your PC sucks
In which case, your money would be better spent on your PC components than your monitor
240hz is where adaptive sync starts to become useful
But I'd prefer 480
Hopefully we'll get 480hz monitors within a couple of years
You know how Overwatch is super laggy at 60fps but fairly smooth at 300fps?
That's why everyone runs OW at low graphics
The game runs like shit at low framerates
input lag=bad
You don't want that shit
You want to minimalise it at all cost
lmao it's not that simple
People don't seek low input lag so they can react faster, but because it helps them aim more accurately
If they need to stop the crosshair on the enemy, they need it to suddenly stop
You still need your crosshair to be near their head
You need the crosshair to be a 1:1 reaction to your mouse movement
Not just aiming, but movement too
CRT monitors are good
Low input lag, high refresh rate
flat panels have only recently caught up
I'm not sure if flat panels have caught up with input lag of CRTs yet even
Refresh rate they have now with 240hz displays
CRTs were made to have high refresh rates so that they wouldn't give office workers headaches
And then flat panels came onto the market and nobody cared about refresh rate
And now they're finally fixing it
10 years too late
Yeah same

I would buy the X2, but I have too many other commitments :(
I will own them one day
niceeeeeeee
DT770s are amazing for work, aren't they?
So comfortable and great isolation
I like how you use really detailed open headphones for home listening too
Why don't you just get an HTC 10?
It's not just a phone
It's a DAC
And a music player
Yes it will
It's got the most amazing headphone output ever
You should consider the Creative E5 too
It's niceeeeeeee

ffs stupid Twitch makes my PC so laggy
Spotify?
I created a ~1000 song playlist on Spotify and songs keep disappearing from it :(
Stupid copyright
Stupid copyright is making me think about going back to pirating music on Bittorrent instead
So is being a fag, Bulwark
The problem is getting the content
It's too labour intensive to build playlists with Bittorrent
And to discover music
And there's no automatic backup
What does it do exactly?
Thanks, I'll save it and have a look later
Can it do sequential downloading so you can listen to the song before the download is finished?
I like that feature in spotify
Yeah I guess so with internet speeds today. I could probably download a 5MB song in like a second
I always find that with torrents it takes quite a few seconds for the client to find peers and the speed to pick up though
It's good once it's got going, but small files still takes ages
What headphones do you have?
You can get super cheap Beyers on ebay that only have one functional driver
I'm going to check with Shure whether my SE215s are real and not fake
Because they sound like shit to me compared to my AKG K702s and Beyer DT770s
And M50Xs
They are cheap IEMs though
If people are allowed to come into the office being overweight, am I allowed to come into the office with overgrown facial hair?

I've played Left 4 Dead and Killing Floor so I think when the zombie apocalypse happens I'll be fine
Get into a corridor and aim shotgun down it usually works quite well
I got accepted for a £500 overdraft last night. I'm going to spend it on an Ncase M1 + 240mm AIO liquid cooler
I've already eaten my lunch
Yeah
0% for 12 months
I have shitloads of money
Almost enough for a 5% deposit on a one bedroom flat
Na
Gonna get 2 bedrooms and get a lodger to pay my mortgage
Yeah it's not much more expensive
It would be more affordable than buying a one bedroom flat for myself
Living with one other person would probably be okay
I wouldn't like getting a 5 bedroom house and finding 4 other people
But as long as it's just one person and they aren't a maniac or anything I think it'll be okay
Maybe it'll be a really cute Asian girl!
Am I allowed to sleep with my tenants?
The black Ncase M1 looks so good
But I have to wait about 2 months for it...
What do you think of the Ncase M1 + Corsair H100i?
I wanna get them so I can OC my CPU and get much better performance
I would get two X61 Krakens and OC my CPU to 5GHz+ but I don't know how to do that
I don't want to do custom loop watercooling because it's super expensive and a bitch to maintain
So I'll just get a high-end AIO I think
But I wanna get as much cooling as possible really because I badly need more CPU performance
Overwatch and CS:GO are so dependant on CPU
Dota 2 not so much now that it has Vulkan
I only download shows I'm going to watch nowadays
I wish Stremio used higher quality torrents
I really want an Ncase M1 now
My CPU has been running at stock speeds for almost a year
Need to OC it a bit
It's bottlenecking my GTX970
Yeah and it seems fairly future-proof
supports ITX mobos and SFX PSUs and full-length GPUs and 2X120mm radiators
Silverstone RVZ01B
Not too good for CPU cooling
Yeah and the stands are rubbish
Because there's not much space left on my desk after 2X24" displays and a 48CM mousepad
And the problem will only get worse when I add a third display
Smaller is better if I can get the same performance in a smaller size
It's only slighty more setup
Long-run it makes no difference
I've never actually had ATX. The largest I've used it mATX
Never needed larger
It's not much harder if you have an SFX modular PSU, ITX mobo, m.2 drive, no ODD
The parts are smaller and you need less cable management
So it's not that much harder than ATX
I used to leave my sides off because the cooling was so bad
On an old case
If in the future I decide that I need more GPU performance and don't need the CPU performance, I can swap the 240mm radiator for a 120mm one and get a GPU with a 120mm one too
But ATM the CPU performance is the big problem for me
I'm chasing framerate
The difference between playing OW at 120fps and 240 is insane
The difference in input lag is so significant
The latest patch dropped my FPS really hard
I wish they'd just port Overwatch to Vulkan already like Valve did with Dota 2
I'm worried this problem is only going to get worse and worse as GPUs keep getting better and CPUs haven't advanced much in like 5 years
What about 5 years from now, is the CPU going to be bottlenecking even entry-level GPUs?
Maybe I need to invest in a larger case to get a 360mm CPU cooler
I doubt it would make /that/ much difference, but it'd be like 500%+ the size of the Ncase M1
I'm gonna need to upgrade to a 6700K at some point I think
My 4690K just isn't fast enough for Overwatch
This game is incredibly badly optimised
It's ridiculous how badly it runs on my PC
And say what?
?
Blizzard don't care about input latency
I want to quit my job and become a millionaire and meet lots of Asian girls

Are these headphones any good? I cannot see them recommended on Reddit or Headfi or anywhere, but they are supposed to have really good isolation and portability, and they are made by a good brand https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sennheiser-HD-380-Pro-Collapsible/dp/B001UE6I0G/ 
I might buy them to replace my M50X which I am really dissatisfied with because of the poor isolation
I need to be more careful with my money now
I really like my M50X, I just wish the isolation didn't suck balls
My K702s are so lovely to listen to as long as there's nobody at home
And nothing going on outside
What have you compared them to?
Have you compared them to DT770s or SE215s at equal decibells?
omg your so stupid
There's Hi-Fi shops in brighton?
Bose lmao
White colller beats
wtf
You have no appreciation for fine music
?
Over-ear headphones aren't really that great for portability I'm finding
I can't replicate the same kind of isolation, water-resistance and small space of my Shure SE215 IEMs
I really prefer over-ears to IEMs though
I find the sound quality and comfort to be a lot better
£70 to get my DT770s modded, or £100 for a pair of Custom One Pros
I hope the Custom One Pros actually have decent isolation though
Because I'm really disappointed with my M50X
What's the most CPU cooling I can get without too much maintenance?
Would a 240mm AIO cooler be best?

btw what do you think of the Ncase M1? I just ordered mine!!!!
I lift heavy and never warm up
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE NCASE OMG
Fuck it's expensive but I want amazing m-itx performance
1080 is like twice as fast as the 480....
How do I vote?
Yeah but have you looked at how much cooling it has for its size?
It's 12.6L
Which is smaller than >90% of cases
But it supports 240mm radiators
And GPU fans
It's a really small sexy-looking case, but it can fit some of the highest-end components inside it
The size:performance ratio is insane
It can easily fit a GTX 1080 and Intel 6700K inside it
And overclock them
Which is an amazing feat considering how tiny the case is
It's just really well designed
Only because I don't have enough cooling performance to overclock at the moment
I've overclocked in the past
lmao HL3 you wish m9

WE GOTTA TAKE BACK CONTROL OF OUR COUNTRY FROM THOSE DIRTY FOREIGNERS
MAKE BRITAIN BRITISH AGAIN
How do I sign up?
Democracy is probably a decent system, but the UK is FAR from a pure democracy
k I guess I'm not voting then
Why?
But the Conservatives and Labour parties do?
Yeah but a pure democracy would still be better than what we have now
You only get a say once every couple of years, and you only have two options
That doesn't really seem like democracy, only a very limited implementation of it
Ideally people should also get a say over stuff debated in parliament, surely?
We have the internet and computers now, so people can communicate that easily
Because of 4chan?
Yeah but paper is expensive and harmful to the environment if you use too much of it
If you mass-produce paper and post it to give the population a vote every week, you don't think that would be expensive?
Why not yet technologically feasible?
How's that different from the current paper ballots?
"if you don't vote then the politicians will do whatever they want" someone just told me
As if David Cameron gives a fuck about my opinion lmao
They really should give everyone two votes. So I can vote for both sides and people will stop flaming me
"immigration doesn't bother me as long as they're coming here to work" LMFAO
So sick of this
I'm at work to work not to discuss politics ffs
lmao I told my parents that people over 80 shouldn't get a vote and they got so pissed off with me
No matter what I say, whether it's that I vote remain, vote leave, or say I'm not voting, someone will flame me
I wish people would stop asking me about it
lmao yeah because they're bored of Countdown and Flog It
They have nothing better to do
I might vote remain because I don't want emmigration to go down
s/emmigration/emigration/
Leave will reduce emigration which is bad
I don't have Facebook
Facebook is not good for your privacy
I just use Whatsapp now
Yeah but E2E encryption
audited by OWS
wtf the Spotify app is constantly being updated but there's no patch notes
They could be. ESEA secretly patched in Bitcoin miners into its software
100m smartphones could generate some beer money for the dev team
I'll get Vive I think
Less douchey companies backing it
I'd back HTC and Valve over Facebook and Mark Fuckerburg any day
I just bought this omg https://www.ncases.com/
What's the difference between Nigel Farage and Nick Griffin?
Yeah but I also need to upgrade my PC's cooling for the summer
It's important to maintain my car and my PC because I depend on them every day
wtf
Well I do regulate my diet and exercise
To maintain my body
I fucking love board meetings. They always have catering and I always have the leftovers
I would love to have first-pickings, but I'm not on the board :(
/r/itsaunixsyste,
system
It's a sub that makes fun of TV shows with unrealistic examples of computer hacking
The two people typing on one keyboard was funny as fuck
The writers sneak it into serious TV shows
Trying to fuck with the audience
Referendums are not legally binding, so legally the Government can ignore the results; for example, even if the result of a pre-legislative referendum were a majority of "No" for a proposed law, Parliament could pass it anyway, because parliament is sovereign.
lmao
I hope people vote leave and then we remain anyway
Would cause some tasty drama
YES I HAVE A ANDROID WORK PHONE NOW
THANKS NEIL FROM IT
http://www.trustedreviews.com/vodafone-smart-prime-7-review
Specs are a bit weak
Office
Android 6.0 niceeeeeeeeeeee
No
South West
Damn, and here I am trying to overclock my PC
You must think I'm an absolute cunt
Hogging all the energy with my overclocked computer
And driving my automobile to work every day
Yeah fuck that
I'm not going
OMG THE RACISTS HAVE WON
hahahaha sure m9
It's all my fault
I'm so glad I ordered the Ncase M1 before the referendum
£ gonna hit rock bottom
Scotland will probably leave the UK now
Scotland wants EU
England doesn't
Scottish people must be pissed
They wanted to stay in the UK and Europe
And now they can't
Yeah but who cares about Northern Ireland?
What?
Why?
Yeah or TI6
wtf
wtf gmail says that in order to use my work email on my personal phone, gmail requires admin rights to my phone
And can disable my camera and wipe the device and shit
Yeah they did, it would just be more convenient to have one phone
ATM I'm carrying two
More weight to carry, harder to keep both charged, etc
What's stopping you from carrying just one?
I'm happy that my workphone finally has Android now
Windoze phone really is a piece of shit
You could just disable work notifications after 17:30
It's weird how my work forces my personal phone to use an insecure PIN instead of my more-secure pattern
I guess it's to stop people from using non-random <9 point patterns
hahahhahaha same
If I didn't have a driving license, I'd have to carry my passport around with me....
Or just not buy alcohol when people ask me for ID
I'd probably do that actually
It would be annoying as fuck
I'm getting asked for ID a lot less than when I was 17 though
Hahahahhahaa when I was 17 I'd give the checkout person my driving license which said I was 17 but most of the time they still sold to me anyway!!!!!!
I deleted my Facebook account
Facebook is wayyyyyyyyy to evil though
I prefer to use WhatsApp and Reddit and stuff
I'm pretty surprised that the racists won actually
Why?
oh ffs I can't uninstall Skype
It's pre-installed bloatware
I'm talking about my personal phone
And I've installed Nova Launcher and Waze on my work phone without problems
I'm glad I spent $225 on the Ncase M1 before the referendum
Otherwise I'd be paying a lot more £££
$13,010,970
How are you today?
omg you've just reminded me it's been so long since I've last had a Dominos!!!!!!!
The £ is so weak compared to a year ago
Why is that?
Why cheap £ good for me?
HOME TIME
$13,887,903
omg I saw someone in Brighton on Sunday wearing M50X on the bus
I wonder if there'll even be a UK in 5 years
Scotland, Ireland and Gibraltar all want to split off
Guernsey too
I don't get it
Where's the punchline?
That's a good question actually, wtf is flirting?
I think girls in the office might be flirting with me quite often
Flirting with me behind my back
Nice, I pretty much have that nailed down already
Flags have become sentient and have hateful thoughts?!?!?!??!?!?!?
What a time to be alive!!!!!!1
I want a Toyota Aygo
Why does my work email require me to use a PIN if my pattern is even more secure than a PIN?
What?
I decrypt my phone with my pattern
I don't have a PIN
Yeah
I use a pattern
I might switch to using a secure passphrase and use a fingerprint to unlock my phone instead
I'd need a phone with a fingerprint scanner though
But fingerprint is wayyyyyyyyyyyy easier to unlock than pattern
wtf https://www.reddit.com/r/Truecels/comments/4q1kmd/i_wish_i_was_chinese/
It's amazing how much extra you have to pay to get stuff added to a Toyota Aygo that you can just do with a Smartphone lmao
Buying second hand is sooooooooo much cheaper than building a luxury bespoke vehicle
And with all those savings, I can build a beastly gaming PC!
Yeah got over £10,000 now including Overdrafts
If Santander didn't decline my application for a graduate account, I'd have £12,000
Okay then I have about £9,300
I haven't tried Google Auto. I use Waze
Need 10% first
Need to wait until October for my First Direct Regular Saver to mature too
Fuck that
The government owns 25% of your home
"The total amount repayable by you
will be the proportion of the market
value of your home that was funded
by this loan, plus interest and
charges"
There won't be a UK within 5 years
Scotland, Ireland, Guernsey and Gibraltar will leave
They'll make their own UK
I'm not because I'm not a criminal like you
what is mgtow?
fuck sake I'm guilty by association
When government unrest starts, we'll be the first ones they come after
wtf is redpill?
I'm at work...
SURE IT IS
I've fallen for that before
Is that a good thing?
If a smartphone is really fucking hot in a car on a hot summer day, does the battery stop charging?
lmao my gf got so angry with me when I asked her to pay for her own food the other day
She told me I am a bad bf
Yeah....
I pay for her food most of the time
Why?
I don't even need a gf who has money, just enough to contribute a proportion
I bought her a couple of meals and topped up her Starbucks card
And travelled 150 miles to visit her
What do you have a gf for then?
lmao you sound gay
no omg because she asked me
I think you're forgetting that my gf is Korean
She comes from a country where they expect their bf to do everything for them
What?
hahahhahaa I remember when you spammed the ops with logs to get me banned once
"was"
ffs I hate it when I'm busy doing something and try to respond to someone in IRC but the conversation has already moved on
I'll probably wait until I buy a new phone before sending my HTC One M9 back to HTC to repair it
CBA to go without a phone for a couple of weeks
I'll get them to repair it then sell it on ebay or trade it in for some £££
I would buy a Samsung Galaxy S7, but the DAC isn't all that great and it doesn't have USB-C or stock Android
Why?
OnePlus 3 isn't waterproof
I damaged my HTC One M9 with water
I want a waterproof one so it doesn't get damaged
S7 is tempting me
You can get an S7 for ~£390
But yeah, the price is putting me off too
ebay
I would buy an HTC 10 if it had decent waterproofing
Like my new PC case? https://www.ncases.com/
hahahahhaha I got the Chinese version of the HTC One M9 and I had to change the language and it was so hard
My PC case is black
Exotic and petite
yay I got some shitty bundles earphones with my Vodafone phone. I'm gonna try them on to see how bad they are
That thing is fucking huge
Over 56L
4.5 times larger than my case...
66 litres holy shit that's a big case
5.2X larger than my case!!!!
What do you think of my Ncase M1?
sorry, meant to ping Lord-Harlot
5.2X larger than my case!!!!
Men can buy perfume too
My gf asks me to buy perfume for her
ffs I can't edit the spreadsheet at the same time as my colleague. She asks me to close it so she can make changes, then flames me for not making the changes to the spreadsheet!!!!
I haven't been on a holiday since I was 14 :(
My parents stopped taking me
I've recently acquired the financial ability to go on holiday, but now I need to save for a house ffs
And now the £ is worthless anyway
lmao I have to wait like 2 months for my Ncase to arrive
Because I ordered the black one
And because I wanted to buy it before the referendum
Black with ODD Slot, Black NO ODD Slot, and Silver NO ODD Slot pre-orders will ship on 2016-JUL-27 PST.
Got ~a month and two weeks left to wait
It's a fucking nice case though
I'm going to put a 240mm rad inside it because I really need the CPU performance ATM
If I ever find I need more GPU power, I can get a hybrid graphics card and change the CPU cooler
But ATM it's my CPU that's the bottleneck
I really need to OC it
4690K @ 3.9GHz
It's bottlenecking my GTX970 @ 1080p
But if I change to 4k then my GPU is the bottleneck
Yeah it's a good card
But even a GTX 1080 can't run 4k well
So I'll stick with 1080p for now
I'll get that 240hz 1080p monitor probably
Na, my case can get >90% of the performance as yours but at 1/5th the size
You should get a broken xbox and playstation off ebay to put near your case
Thieves are always console peasants
Yeah but it would still be a hassle
You have to pay excess
And you'd have to re-order, rebuild, and reinstall everything
Would be a big hassle
wtf you talking about m9?
Oh the politics man
wtf they voted for him a few months ago and now they want to remove him?
Are Labour MPs really that retarded?
Oh right
So the parliament don't respect the public's opinion?
Well labour MPs sure do sound like cunts
No ofc not, I was just trying to understand the situation
What is the fucking point of a vote if the MPs are just going to override it
Emma Watson?
Is Ryan Seacrest a candidate?
Dominoes is fucking delicious
I want a burrito
And a Dominoes
But not a quiche, that's too boring
wtf IT told me that they can't install Lync on my phone. Last night I installed it on my PC and my phone
wat
TLDR?
ANYEOUNG HASSEYO
wtf are symantec products
lmfao who uses antivirus in 2016
saranghaeyo
mianhae
LMFAO
I don't know all the new pokemons
$14,038,137
Did you know that kpop is the best music genre because it has the highest production value in the world?
that's not kpop you pleb
I just use my computer monitors as TVs
No idea
I just use my 24" 144hz monitor
Isn't bitrate more important than resolution anyway?
I just sit closer to it
This one looks pretty good https://www.amazon.co.uk/Phillips-BDM4350UC-00-43-Inch-Professional/dp/B01CO2QT4M?ie=UTF8&tag=pcp0f-21
But it's 4k
It's got 5ms response time
And it's IPS
2 displayport ports, 2 HDMI and 1 VGA
You can use it as four 21" 1080p displays instead of one 4k display
So you're basically buying four monitors instead of one
21" isn't that small
I think I'm working using 21" displays right now
What's 42.5/2?
Just over 21"?
ffs it's so tempting to buy lots of expensive electronics when I have £10,000 in the bank
lmao I don't have a "good credit rating"
I have a shit credit rating
It's a 970
Why, are you interested in buying it?
It's actually powerful enough for me atm
I might be interested in selling it
I prefer nVidia atm
ATI still has shit Linux drivers
hahahhahaha Neil from IT told me that I look great yesterday
Because I work out and shit
wtf
If my credit score was better, I'd have a £2,000 interest-free overdraft right now
I think once my Ncase and 240mm rad arrive I won't have much reason to upgrade my PC itself for a while
I just need more CPU performance
No point getting a GTX 1080 if my CPU will just bottleneck it
I need a new mouse and 240hz monitor
And a house
And headphones
And phone
Looks like the RX 480 sucks compared to the GTX 970
I really need Overwatch to run better
It runs like shit on Windoze and doesn't run at all on Linux
 Well yes it will, because Overwatch is extremely framerate dependant
What's your mmr?
wtf I have no stats
"We don't have any stats for this player yet."
It says "up to date"
How do I get it to import my stats?
Did that, still doens't work
Samsung#2781
Yes
Deaths "INFINITELY BETTER"
IDK how accurate those stats are yet
Competitive mode isn't out
Do I need to play a game after adding myself to the site?
Live with parents for free brah
I wish I had some DDs
So I could get banking bonuses
The banks would give me money if I had some DDs
Like £££
http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts#bonus
Got credit card and paypal
Spotify doesn't count though
Most people in shared houses don't have many direct debits because they aren't paying the bills directly
I pay £5 a month for Spotify
hahahahahha I bet you wish you could
£5 every month is >£60
Do you know how many things you can buy with £60?
When I was 16 £60 was like a fortune
Spotify is really expensive actually
I choose to only pay them £5
I only play CS:GO, Dota 2 and Overwatch online
Fuck other games
lmao I don't have friends
http://masteroverwatch.com/profile/pc/eu/Tomface-2873/compare/b255f3e7dc1fcde1
Took hours though
Yeah, just can see overall stats
I haven't really learnt any of the heroes yet anyway
CS hero
omg got my car insurance last night for only £186
I only have a year of no claims
And I'm under 25
So I got a good deal I think
Na not this time
My mum arranged my insurance for me last year and put a black box in my car
This time I arranged it myself
Fully comp, no black box
£100 excess
Well she arranged it last time because she wanted to pay for the insurance to help get me driving
The only problem is that my insurance is for women
http://www.diamond.co.uk/
£300 handbag cover...
Comprehensive policies include £300 Handbag & Contents cover, 24-hr accident helpline, & Courtesy Car when yours is repaired at an approved garage.
They didn't ask me for that on the phone last night....
I just bought £300 handbag insurance
GTAV? That game is expensive
I thought about buying it when it was on sale, but I'm way too busy with Dota 2, CS:GO and Overwatch to play other games right now
I played some ranked last night
Lost my first game, won my second
Was pretty fun but nobody ever communicates
There is zero communication in this game
It doesn't seem as much of a team game as CS:GO
Because in CS:GO you NEED coms
You NEED to work together
Yeah but these are competitive team esports
Usually you need to communicate in these sort of games
Like in Dota and CS:GO you need to communicate
If you don't communicate then you're not working as a team
What about respawn/push timing?
You need to co-ordinate to push together instead of dying solo I think?
This game doesn't seem to have enough depth to become a big esport
But considering how incredibly successful it's been, it probably will be
CS:GO has economy and recoil and grenades and movement and stuff
It's got a bit more depth to it than Overwatch
What rank are you in CS:GO?
lmao and Overwatch is for adults then?
I'm trying to figure out which 240mm radiator I will put in my Ncase M1
It looks like I need one with flexible tubing
So not the H100i V2, but the H100i V1 should be fine
And the H105 could be good, but it might be slightly too thick
yeah
For CPU cooling
Where is that?
Holy shit https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B014F9QHVC/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=7R48SBR3UC6Q&coliid=I3NG2K1FSVCYW2
I think I'll get a Corsair H105 for my Ncase M1
Should give me a shitload of overclocking
Why is it so satisfying?
I might start using my IEMs more since my M50X's isolation is so terrible.
My SE215s aren't that bad when I squeeze the foam down really hard and insert into my ear as deep as I can
I just ordered these for £74.63 https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B008XEYT48/
I ordered this for £50 too https://www.scan.co.uk/products/corsair-hydro-h105-240mm-all-in-one-liquid-cpu-cooler-refurbished-12-month-warranty
Fucking bargain
That cooler is £100 on Amazon
fuck sake Valve stop raping my wallet http://blog.dota2.com/2016/06/weekend-bundle-sale/
Can I eat a Pot Noodle in the office?
What?
 Who got paid?
WHO GOT PAID!??!?!?!
Anyeoung hasseyo

wtf immigrants eat swans?
That's news to me
Never heard anyone complain about that before, HansProleman
HAHHAHHAHA
It's full of weirdos too
Are you gay?
THE SWANS OMG
your sick
they're*
Did you vote leave?
you fucking racist
Brownies are delicious
I'd rather be a sick fuck than a racist
ffs why do some companies not publicly show their email address

ffs I really need a poo but I am worried that my colleague will flame me for leaving my desk for too long
I wish the HTC 10 was waterproof so I could buy it
The S7 doesn't have as good a DAC or software
Or USB-C
If I had to choose, I'd go for the S7 because of the waterproofing though
My HTC One M9 is fucked now
With water
wtf my IEMs always have ear wax on them when I take them out of my ears
Because portable headphones are a pain in the ass
You have to sacrafice sound quality and convenience and comfort
And I can't nail down my portable listening strategy
My M50X's isolation fucking sucks
Soooooo annoyed!!!!
wtf
What headphones do you use?
Sorry, I'm on webchat
What headphones do you use?
Damn that sucks
Have you considered getting a defective pair of Beyers or something that only has one functional driver?
You can probably get one super cheap on ebay if you have a look
It's a good suggestion though....
Just because you can't hear in stereo doesn't mean you can't benefit from good headphones
If you got a £20 pair of DT770s with only one working driver that would be amazing for you
wtf does this include the headphones? http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/beyerdynamic-custom-one-pro-gaming-headset-
I think they're trying to scam people
ffs TSB reduced its monthly saver interest rate from 5% to 2%
For new accounts
I was planning to renew mine in December
What's money tips?
Hmmmmm maybe I can keep the interest if I renew
I doubt it
Yeah but the market has gotten worse
Not so many good deals on atm
I'm so fucking glad I got the Halifax Help to Buy ISA before they halved the interest rate
I'm gonna have a shitload of cash by December
Gotta find somewhere to hoard it
Tesco let you drop 2X3,000 into two accounts without any monthly pay-ins
An easy fix if you have too much cash
But I want 5%+
$14,913,055
Nope, still growing
I doubt it will this year
Maybe next year
No I think they're gonna give "no safe haven" to imaginary abusers
But still, either interpretation doesn't really make sense
wtf is she actually trying to say?
IMAGINED PEOPLE DONT EXIST OMG
ffs that tweet is so fucking stupid
YEAH BUT WTF DOES SHE MEAN BY IMAGINED CHILDREN/ABUSERS?!?!??!?!?
And does she really expect us to believe that anyone thinks the UK is a safe haven and the police don't care?!??!?
wtf
At best it's stupid and ignorant, at worst it's stupid and makes no sense
wtf is loli hentai
wtf is the point of police if politicians need to use twitter to keep our children safe?!?!?!?!?
yeah not gonna click on that thanks m9
if she was serious, why doesn't she just say something like "police forces will receive more funding to tackle sexual abuse" or something?
Instead of some stupid generic statement
She's a fucking bad politician
srsly between conservative MPs saying stupid shit and labour MPs trying to oust a democratically elected leader, they're all a bunch of twats who shouldn't be running the country
Yeah with a minimum standard criteria too
2k wtf?
2.5k is about average AFAIK
It doesn't have a limit
I'd say 2k is scrub tier
Below average = scrub tier
I wouldn't trust anyone less than 3k
3k isn't good, but it's not absolutely fucking horrible
https://yasp.co/distributions
Oh looks like average is about 3,150 now
Maybe people that stopped playing at 4k to protect their mmr
pros
Arteezy is over 9,000

Gonna level up in CS:GO
Gonna get a ranking in Overwatch
Gonna drive my mum to places because I live at home for free
I just got my car insurance for only £186 http://www.diamond.co.uk/
wtf are you talking about
Dota's entire business model is selling cosmetics
I am?
what
Holy shit we breached 2%?
That's a big bump wtf
lmao
wow there's a lot of fat middle-aged white women in my office
Korean girls are racially superior
wtf
you sound like a fucking nazi
I prefer girls with strong asian features
no whiteys etc
wat
fuck, I use openmailbox.org
Hope they don't close down
well if the domain changed that would be just as inconvenient...
holy fuck the playlist I created on Spotify has 62 followers
lmfao
I have smoked before
My SE215s actually do a really fantastic job of isolation with the foam tips when I squeeze them tight and insert them in deep
They aren't as comfortable or nice-sounding as my K702s or DT770s or M50X though
The level of isolation my SE215s provide blows my M50X out of the water
My M50X isolates almost as badly as an open pair of headphones lmao
Thanks for the tip
It's less convenient to put IEMs in and take the moff
IEMs take some time to get the fit in right
So I prefer DT770s in the office
What are your IEMs?
Is this a good deal? http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Samsung-Galaxy-S7-SM-G930-32GB-Black-Onyx-Unlocked-Smartphone-/222170235261?hash=item33ba60c17d:g:bVMAAOSwjXRXa-nT
I'm looking at IE80
fuck you're lucky
You use your work SIM for personal phone calls too?
When walking around outside, do you use your IEMs or circumaural headphones?
I thought we were >2% now?
damn
We need that to be 100%
Yeah I think I'm gonna use my IEMs instead of my M50X
They just have way better isolation
My M50X is only any good for taking with me if I'm visitng somewhere I guess
Because my new Beyer Custom One Pros will replace it for home use
My DT770s replaced it for office use
And my SE215s replace it for portable use
So really my M50X doesn't do anything that my other headphones don't do better
Except be both comfy, good-sounding, and portable at the same time
My M50X doesn't fit into my lineup as much as I would have liked :(
I just ordered a display arm
Gonna reclaim the space on my desk so I can work from home
With amazing high-fi headphones, triple monitor set up, incredibly powerful and quiet computer, etc etc
I JUST BOUGHT A DISPLAY ARM
GONNA RELCIAM MY DESK
It looks super easy
Just attach it all together
Nothing to do with walls
It's a desk mount
Gonna free up a shitload of space on my desk
I CBA with wall mounts
clamps

Nice sarcasm m9

no need to be a dick
Hey wanna buy some headphones?
Or even sell me some headphones?
WTB headphones WTS headphones
Is there an IRC channel dedicated to trading headphones?
I want to buy Philips Fidelio X2
I want to sell Audio Technica M50X and Beyer DT770 80Ohms
They were shit, you wouldn't want them,
I threw them out
Bad sound quality and very worn-down
Better sound quality, but no noise cancellation
I'd recommend against it
Good IEMs>Backbeat Pros
Or even DT770s are pretty good at isolating
Getting CubanPete's headphones
Don't buy his shit
NC hiss, clunky design, artificial sounding, bass heavy.
These are better https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shure-SE215-Dynamic-Microdriver-Earphones/dp/B004PNZFZ8/
Or these https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyerdynamic-DT770-Pro-Headphones-Ohm/dp/B0016MNAAI/
I fucking love my DT770s for the office
Isolates the sound, sound quality is amazing, and it's super fucking comfy
What's your office set?
I just use the work-supplied shitty headset for Lync :(
CBA to buy a decent headset just for Lync which I don't use that much anyway
I use my HTC phone as my source
I use a proper headset for Lync from home
Actually, I could probably use Lync with a headset on my personal phone.,...
Yeah you got any for sale?
£90 including P&P but I'm gonna wait until my Custom One Pros arrive to see if they'll be a good replacement first
Mianhae
Used the wrong IRC command sry
They look fucking awful
Why?
Sure, I'll keep you posted!
Yeah and the DT770 pads are fucking amazing
Yeah and makes your ears warm and uncomfortable!!!!!
You have COPs?
Shit I just bought some to replace my DT770s
They're only 16ohms
I got a really fucking good deal on these
£76 on Amazon wtf
My K702s at 62ohms are harder to drive than my DT770s at 80ohms
IDK how that works
Yeah I got a great deal because I've been looking out for them for several months now, just waiting for a good deal to pop up
wtf you travelled all the way to Singapore just to buy headphones?!?!?!??
They bought them for you?
Headphones are cheaper in Singapore?
Please can your family buy me Philips Fidelio X2?
Is your family Chinese then?

Also, I got £186 car insurance when I'm 24 with only one years no claims ^^
And I got £50 Corsair H105!!!!!!
Free is good!!!!
wtf how did you get your ANC headphones for free?
All my work gave me was a shitty headset, shitty laptop, and shitty phone
Nothing I'd personally want to use
I mostly use my own gear for work now lmao
I think this is what my work gave me http://www.plantronics.com/uk/product/savi-400
God it's awful
"Superior audio quality" my ass
That shit is so overpriced
Who the fuck buys this shit? https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plantronics-203948-02-Wireless-Headset-System/dp/B013SF5D3C/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1467487766&sr=8-2&keywords=savi+400
Is the UK not going to have any more astronauts post-brexit?
Or maybe the government will build our own space program. If North Korea can do it so can we!!!!
Will paying off my overdrafts every month improve my credit score?

He stayed around to get all the glory now leaving to avoid the fallout
Like Tony Blair hahahahhahaa
No angry mob when the UK's economy goes down the toilet
People will be angry at his successor instead
Well I guess Theresa May will be getting all the hatemail instead of Nigel Frarage then
I love how the two choices to be USA president 2016 are a racist bigot and a criminal lmao
The other way around, idiots
Hmmmmm I think my work wifi may be blocking IMAP and SMTP ports

Would you be interested in my thoughts once I receive them?
No, but it is polite to ask
lmfao I am on lunch but I'm literally just sitting at my desk blasting my DT770s

yeah it sucks :(
This is my new wallpaper https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ODDws7u3jO4/maxresdefault.jpg

Really good for picking wallpapers I think
wtf I thought they're still on their first season?
I don't think people are going to accept any new presenters because the old trio were in place for so long

yay my Duronic monitor arm has arrived
If it works well I'll order a second one for my other monitor
wtf
It's only half way to Christmas
Christmas is still almost 6 months away
Also, Christmas sucks

ANYEOUNG rory
kinda
Lots of clouds about
niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I got my Duronic monitor arm today
Gonna free up some space on my desk
Might order another one for my other monitor if I'm pleased with it
Currently using old textbooks to prop up my monitor because its stand doesn't have height adjustment....
??????
I probably can, but it's just as cheap to get them individually, and it makes it easier to manage
You can get arms which support 6 monitors or more
IDK if I'll be using 21:9 in the future though
Yeah same....
I don't like the ones on the market atm because the response times are so high
I don't think ultrawides are quite good enough for me atm
Overwatch is getting 21:9 support soon!
I've actually been considering getting a 4k monitor and using it like 4X1080p
I usually get the sugar-free drink
no sugar inside it
My gf wants to make babies with me lmao
wtf
btw that reminds me, my Beyerdynamic Custom One Pros are on their way!!!!!
We'll find out!
I'm going to try them with the stock pads before deciding whether to keep them or not, so I won't be able to tell you my initial impressions of them with the DT770 pads, even though I intend to buy them
If they're good, I might sell my DT770s
Because of Mandela?
I'm glad I don't live in Rhodesia
It's really become a shithole since Mugabe seized power

What was it like?
wtf
why
$16,761,578
I think we're gonna go >$20m this year
I hope this desk-mounted monitor arm won't be too much of a pain to install tonight
There's a big $1m CS:GO tournament going on in Cologne right now
It's a major
It's got that LoL-faggot called Thorin
ffs it's such a pain to try and get my money back from the student loans company
Fucking hell they're bad
They were gonna give me less than I should get
Then I told them they got their figures wrong
Now they're giving me more
Assholes
So hard to get my money back from them
They're slow as fuck and try to pay out less than they should
Well kinda
He does LoL stuff too
He tried to produce Dota content but he wasn't received well
Because he basically just took stuff off the front page of Reddit that everyone already knows because he knows nothing about Dota
Holy shit I've just finished installing this, and now I have a shitload of space on my desk https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00HYXDXVO/
Gonna buy another one for the other monitor
Parliament can overturn it and do whatever the fuck they want
Like go to war with Iraq or some shit
So fucking glad I bought my Ncase M1 just before the referendum
Saved a shitload of £££
omg my new monitor arm is amazing
How low will the £ drop? I want to get off Farage's wild wild AmerieHartree
Looks like it'll be Teresa May...
Why is it that the USA and UK have such terrible leaders which are forced onto the nation even though we are supposed to be a democracy lmao
lmao
USA isn't in EU and look how fucked up their politics are
I can't imagine a democratic country having a worse political situation than the USA has
Only way to get worse than that is a dictatorship
If you are leaving a job and have a couple of weeks holiday built up, can you use your two weeks holiday and start another job during your holiday?
Or is that ill eagle?
wtf Oscar Pistorious convicted of murder but only gets 6 years in jail
14 years?
So yesterday the £ had its biggest drop since the referendum
Today could be a big drop too
Basically the dreams of me being able to go on holidays abroad like my parents has been shattered
However, the TI6 prizepool is now $16,832,276 which is good

"diluting" wtf?
You sound like a nazi
Got my new Beyers!
Initial thoughts, seems good, isolation seems good
Ears starting to warm up in pleather pads...
Gonna need to mod these pads
I think these could replace my DT770s if I replace the pads with DT770s
The DT770 pads are fucking comfy
Custom One Pro pads warm my ears up....
Have you tried the hybrid pads? Velour on the inside and pleather on the outside
Supposed to be a good compromise between the two
How much is that in £ PPP?
If he earns 100X less than us but has 100X cheaper living expenses, then he is no poorer
If he earns 100X less than us but have 200X cheaper living expenses, he's probably richer than us
There's a shortage of bread half the time I go to the bakery section of my local bakery
lmao the team who manages our internal website just made it so much worse
I'm actually quite impressed with the COPs, they aren't as bad as people said they are
I definitely prefer them over my M50X
IDK why they have such a bad reputation
They are superior to my M50X in every way, except for not being foldable
They aren't too dissimilar to my DT770s in terms of soundstage and sound quality
I bet you can't get nicer headphones than these for less than £75
Strangely they're 16 ohms but only slightly easier to drive than my 80ohms DT770s
I put my DT770 pads on them
Now they're so nice
I put my DT770s pads on my COPs
I'm really enjoying them now
They sound fantastic on my Creative E5 AMPDAC
I might sell my DT770s now
That's what I'm thinking of doing actually...
Then buy a second COP for the office
Yeah maybe...
I guess these don't have a cable so they're more portable to take into the office each day
Maybe I'll just get a hard case and leave a spare cable in the office
Thanks for your advice
You're helping me manage my compulsive spending problem :)
I think I have a problem because I wanna buy Sennheiser IE80s and Philips Fidelio X2 now.....
And Samsung Galaxy S7
Ncase M1, H105 CPU cooler, Toyota Aygo, 240hz monitor
I'm gonna delay selling my DT770s for a while and make sure the COPs are for me
I might sell my M50X too 
The only thing I don't like about the COPs is that they don't fold up....
haha Beyer calls the COPs "Headphones 2.0"
I shit you not m9
I might get a V-Moda Boompro for work, connect it to my phone, then answer Lync calls on my phone instead of using the fucking shitty headset that I get provided at work
French ecstacy
Just contact ebay or paypal if you have a problem with the item
Maybe stop doing drugs, you druggie
The £ is up today
I want petrol to be cheap ffs
I buy lots of foreign goods
Yeah so it's up on yesterday
Actually it's almost 1.3
Doesn't matter to me too much atm because I'm gonna cut down on my spending
Might even benefit me if I sell my DT770s now for a good price
Wanna buy my DT770s?
I'm going to stop buying random shit I don't need now
I spent a shitload of £££ over the past couple of weeks
£185 Ncase m1, £50 Corsair H105 CPU cooler, £75 Beyer Custom One Pro, £186 car insurance, ~£45 monitor arms, £10 of aux cables, etc
Nice sarcasm m9
Usually to store the brain, mouth, nose, eyes, etc
A stool only needs three
You can get stools with 4 legs
It's gonna have shit mobility though
fuck sake Spotify is using power faster than my phone can charge
I think the bad reputation Beyer Custom One Pros has is undeserved
I think it's a pretty good little headphone
It feels more durable than my DT770s since it has a removeable cable instead of a really long one
The bass in the third position is just how I like it
It's really similar to the DT770 except it has a removeable cable
And it costs the same amount that I was quoted to get a removeable cable attached to my DT770s lmao
Beyerdynamic makes some bloody good headphones
I love how Amazon said they had "minor cosmetic wear" but they seem good as new lmao
Absolute fucking bargain
I bet you can't get headphones this good for cheaper than £75
You probably can't get better headphones for less than £130 haha
omfg
That first one looks like heart attack on a plate
I want to go to this resteraunt in America called Heart Attack Grill
I saw it on Man vs Food
what the fuck?
Why?
That sounds really fucking irresponsible
The owner sounds like a deutsche
I mean a douche
He should be tried for manslaughter
At 10,000 calories I bloody well hope they're nice
Why?
What's wrong with it?
Damn I should have said "At 9,001 calories"
That would be a dank meme
hahahhahaha I love how Richard Dawkings disproves omnipotent deities but all the religious people just ignore me

I rewrote my sentence and forgot a word, I do it all the time
You know when you rewrite a sentence but forget to change all the words so it makes sense?
Being a hobo would not be fun
Would it be cheaper to borrow £15,000 as a loan instead of a mortgage? Mortgages have crazy set up costs
Use your holiday days then
I don't want to use my holiday days because my mum will complain I am just spending all my time playing video games and ask me to walk her dog and do chores and shit
Depends on the speed the bus is going at
If it hits you at an extremely low speed, nothing will happen
If it hits you at an extremely high speed, you will probably die
There are phone lines available to talk to you if you're feeling suicidal
Talk to Frank or some shit
I thought Frank is for people who are feeling suicidal?
Or is that Good Samaritans?
Why did you meet drug dealers when you can just use the dark web?
Can you talk to them even if you're not a quitter?
Silkroad isn't the only site
There's lots of druggie markets
I can't discuss specifics because it's against the rules IIRC
I don't want to meet drug dealers IRL
They're weird people
Really sketchy
wtf is a deloran
wtf is a delorean
wat
So can you only talk to Frank if you're a quitter!?!??!?
I haven't seen that film
I don't know about American cars
IDK
I've seen Zoolander
What are you talking about?
yay I'm going to get my second monitor arm today
I'm gonna be fully kitted out for working from home tomorrow
The £ has climbed a lot today
World better because of Iraq War"
lmfao

Fuck sake looks like Teresa May is gonna be the next PM
This country is so fucked
I wish we'd stop electing shit people to run the country
If Teresa May becomes PM, she's gonna try and spy on everyone
I'd love European citizenship
So if the UK goes to shit I can just move to Europe
I don't speak Deutschland m9
My English isn't very good either
 How much time a week do the German lessons take?
Learning German is hard...
Can't Germany just learn English?
Maybe if we kept occupying the country post WW2 then they would speak English like USA and India do today
wtf is PoF?
Is this worth anything? http://www.royalmint.com/shop/Peter_Rabbit_2016_UK_50p_BU_Coin
yay nobody around me can hear my new beyers even when I crank them up really high and open up the bass ports
I asked the person sitting behind me if they can hear anything and the response "none at all"
I really think these can replace my COPs
In fact, they're so good I might even replace my M50X with them
Although the M50X folding is so nice....
It's High Noon
hahahahhahaha I just wrote a long email to my manager and colleague and I'm going to defer it until early tomorrow morning to make it look like I started work early when actually I'll still be in bed
Not done it before
How would they know
It would be more likely that I started early and wrote the email than deferred it until the morning

hahahahahaha I got pirated MS Office 2010 with Outlook and Lync all working on my gaming PC with my double monitors and monitor arms
With Hi-Fi headphones and mic and AMPDAC
So I don't have to use the shitty laptop and headset they gave me
My laptop isn't on, but I'm logged into Lync and Outlook
My manager can see I'm on Lync
I don't need the laptop if I'm at home. I have used the laptop when waiting at the Car Dealership whilst my car was being worked on though
I don't have my own laptop
hahhahahahhaa just did a Lync call using my Creative E5 + Beyer Custom One Pro + V-Moda Boompro
lmao I'm watching CS:GO esports whilst working from home
haahahahahaha I'm just wearing tracksuits and a t-shirt. I hope nobody tries to webcam call me
I don't even have a webcam plugged in atm....
Who is infra?
How will they access my webcam if I don't have one plugged in?
Why don't you just use your own PC?
I have a work laptop too but I'm using my gaming PC instead
Who are you talking about?
What are you watching?
[10:29:22] wow in America the police shoot to kill over 1,000 people a year
[10:29:33] And citizens shoot and kill the police too
[10:29:47] It seems like they have too many guns
Do you remember the Aquasnap cd key you gave me? I've forgotten it :(
"The Dallas attack marks the deadliest toll on US law enforcement officers since the 9/11 attacks in 2001."
Well the amount of people being killed would probably decrease if there were less guns
Guns make it very easy to kill people
Well I'm sure the problem would be similar if everyone was equipped with flamethrowers or crossbows or RPGs
Or attack both at the same time
Guns ARE a problem
Americans can't be trusted with guns though
It's like comparing the average American to a highly trained special forces military personal
Until America is a much more peaceful country, gun control should be increased
Stats don't lie m9
Look how many people are shot in the USA every year
lmao are you trolling me?
hey
How are you today, m9?
Do you have a Hi-Fi shop in Leeds where you can try on headphones before you buy them>

He works for the RAF
Is it abnormal to sometimes think about suicide?
Some days I feel so down
I never really plan it out or strongly consider it though
So I don't think I am at all suicidal
What other things are indicators of depression? I don't think I have depression but it's a possibility
lmao someone called me a bigot for saying Americans shouldn't have as many guns today
fuckkkkk maybe I do have depression
Although feeling down isn't consistent, sometimes I feel great when I'm pwning noobs in online video games
Or when I finish a session in the gym and my muscles look so ripped in the mirror
Not drugs?
By "best" do you mean most effective, or least side effects?
I never stretch
What happens if I don't stretch?
I did that once to my bottom and it hurt like a bitch for about 15 minutes
It hurt so fucking much
I haven't had it since though
I usually just do a couple of warm up sets with lighter weights
What headphones do you use?
lmao
Get some proper Beyers
Why do you have poor hearing? How do you know you have poor hearing?
Everyone can't hear certain frequencies
I think I'm deaf above 17khz
Damn I'm sorry about that
I wonder what my hearing is like. I've listened to a lot of loud music....
But I really enjoy my hearing so I hope it's not too bad
And I hope I don't get Tinnitus!!!!!!
I probably have more high-end equipment than rory
Citrix Receiver keeps locking my session omg!!!!!

Oh and got prosecuted too
omg I just cooked a meal
Mummy went away to London and left me instructions on how to cook chicken and shit
Korean girls are physically and intellectually superior to Aryans
I think in general, but feel free to pick at straws in your vein attempt to prove me wrong
Like most SJW sympathisers do
Yes, most people who disagree with me haven't
Ignorance breeds misconceptions
The only people who don't think Korean girls are racially superior are stupid ignorant racists
Like Adolf Hitler, Donald Trump, and Teresa May
Yeah fuck those guys
Fuck Teresa May our next power-hungry self-centered bitch PM
He did a lot of good things actually, people just focus on the people he imprisoned and killed
Hitler supported good treatment for animals and turned Germany's economy around
Yes, that too
Germany is in a very good place today because of Hitler
I really dislike him for his racism though. The bastard didn't even recognise how racially superior Korean girls are
And he didn't build enough cool Zeppelins
If Hitler met Korean girls there wouldn't have been a WW2
Got to walk dog now bye
lmfao
My mum reads the Daily Mail and watches Eastenders
wtf?
Nice sarcasm m9
Yes you are
Nobody reads the Daily Mail because it's a trash newspaper and nobody watches Eastenders because few people have no lives
lmao I think my mum just votes on whatever the Daily Mail tells her to
LMFAO no they don't
If the Daily Mail was the biggest newspaper then we wouldn't have gone to war with Germany
Jews would be extinct today if the Daily Mail was popular
There wouldn't be an EU but rather Europe would be Germany
I love how you think everyone is mouthbreathers
I bet David Cameron and Nigel Farage and Rupert Murdoch think you're a mouthbreather
to them your just a pleb
Everyone thinks that
Those people think that unemployed people are the mouthbreathers
It's just one demographic looking down at another in a cycle
Rupert Murdoch think you're a mouthbreather, you think I'm a mouthbreather, I think my mum is a mouthbreather, my mum thinks my unemployed aunty is a mouthbreather, she thinks Polish people are mouthbreathers, etc
Everyone is a mouthbreather to someone
lmfao I thought you had a really low opinion of me or something
What are your eligibility requirements for being a mouthbreather then?
I believe you're misinformed there m9
I like the nerd equivalent of football and page 3 girls
Which is Dota and kpop
are you a bit drunk after drinking with your daddy?
I might treat myself to a Kronenburg tonight
Just the one.
Thought so, you sound very drunk
your slurring your words a little
How do you know if foreigners are mouthbreathers if they don't have Daily Mail and page 3 and football?
You're a bit of an elitist, aren't you?
Do you believe in eugenics?
Do you think we should bring back Apartheid?
Do you think Korean girls are physically and intellectually superior to Aryans?
Hitler wasn't a dumb man
He knew what he was doing
Austria and Germany are very advanced civilisations
They engineer the best headphones in the world
My AKGs are made in Austria and my Beyers in Germany
Hitler was the leader of the most advanced civilisation in Europe
wtf is big brother anyway
That's the show about the people living in a house together?
With drama forced by the producers to create entertainment?
Well I know what it is, but not what the point of it is
It doesn't have a plot and doesn't teach you anything interesting AFAIK
Don't the audience just vote people off if they don't like them?
And the producers manipulate the production to make some people less likeable?
This is what I watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-a8lPAphSE
hmmmmm what do you think about GoT? Lots of mouthbreathers watch that but it's actually a really well produced show with lots of plot
But the mouthbreathers watch it too!!!!!
I want to live in a country where the only girls are Asian
wtf you'll arrange to deport all the white people?!?!?!?
how the fuck
Racial seperation can be a very good thing if done right
My type is Asian
Only an ignorant person doesn't consider the possibility that one race may be physically and intellectually superior to another
Holy shit adding monitor arms to the two monitors on my desk is FUCKING NICE
My desk feels twice as big
Yeah but objectively Korean girls are clearly superior physically and intellectually than Aryan girls
You just want to prevent mouthbreathers from breeding
Like a benevolent dictator
So you want to inject chemical castration into plebfood?
The lowest pleb is more likely to win the lottery than you or me
Well maybe not you
But definitely me
I wasn't sure because I got the impression you're a bit irresponsible with money
Are weeaboos mouthbreathers?
or plebs whatever
And what about LoL players?
I wish Hitler was alive today to gas 9001million LoL players
lmfao why?
But I don't do drugs?
Wow it's amazing how nonchalantly you call people retards
"you're mentally disabled"
As in mentally retarded
As in retarded
That's what retarded means, you retard
It's interesting to see your racist ideology unrepressed
What will happen to Korean girls in youir 'Brave New World' then?
I really really like my new Beyers
The Germans can live, I need their precision German engineering
PRECISION GERMAN ENGINEERING
Holy shit I thought I broke my headphones 10 mins ago
I took my COPs out with me for a walk and the right cup stopped working
Got home, can't reproduce the problem

Console gaming never took off in China because the government banned the sale of consoles
The government was very anti-gaming, but they can't ban PC components because people need them
I want to play Pokemon Go in Socal
I might, I need to order some more protein powder soon
I don't they can outcompete myprotein.com though
myprotein.com is 25% off too most of the time
There are lots of cute girls playing Pokemon Go in Socal
I went outside yesterday and I got sunburnt
hmmmmm same price http://www.myprotein.com/sports-nutrition/impact-whey-protein/10530943.html
WINNER"
Which one?
 What's that?
Oh right illegal drugs okay
God doesn't exist lmao
Did you know that Overwatch has stolen a lot of CS:GO's and LoL's player and viewer bases?
Yeah, casual gamers often move to whatever the next big casual game is
Dota hasn't shrunk at all though
Well Dota 2 isn't really old
It's newer than LoL and CS:GO

You're just jealous because my gf is Korean
fuck off you racist
What are the best value headphones you've ever bought? Mine are probably my £74.63 Beyer Custom One Pros
Actually, rory is a headphone enthusiast
lmao filthy casual
£1 headphones must be so shit
But they sound 74X worse
I think isolation is an important features of closed-back cans, otherwise why not just go open?
And soundstage is an important feature of circumaural, otherwise why not go IEM?
That's why I don't think M50X is a good pair of headphones
It has the soundstage of IEMs and the isolation of open backs
Whereas my Beyers have good soundstage and isolation
M50X is massively overhyped IMO
wtf it's so weird how my 16ohm Custom One Pros aren't any easier to drive than my 80ohm DT770s
rory:

I want unlimited data for £10 a month
I'm paying £5 a month for 500MB atm and I just about have enough
Just barely
1250MB for £5 a month not bad
Yeah and you get a new flagship smartphone every year IIRC?
How does SIM cashback work?
Is it cheaper to get a dual sim phone and get one sim for phone calls and one for data?
Because I don't need many minutes or text, but I need lots of data
How much data do you actually need?
I've been using a 500MB data contract for almost a year now
Yeah I intentionally avoid listening to online Spotify playlists and streaming videos and stuff
You probably stream some videos to your phone?
Do you watch HD Youtube videos and Twitch?
What?
Should I disable mobile internet then if I only use Wi-Fi?
IDK just wondering how disabling Wi-Fi saves you battery
So I should disable bluetooth and NFC and flashlight too?
wow how do you use so much data? I never use more than 500MB
wtf?
You're really creepy
That grill in my office was just flirting with me again
Asking "how are you" and shit like that
no I have a gf omg
I don't see the point in being in a relationship with someone if I'm just going to cheat on them
wtf
"Hermes Unsuccessful, security issue"
07/07/2016  10:21  Parcel ready for collection
wtf does that mean
They're supposed to deliver it
wtf Hermes said someone at work called S Atkinson took it at my office
But nobody with that name works here?
So confused
Reception told me nothing ever arrived
Fucking DPD kept bouncing me between each other
They need to sort their shit out
lol no it's a CPU cooler
wtf is a hobo going to do with that
The courier would be retarded to give my parcel to a hobo instead of the receptionist anyway
That seems really unlikely
I think Hermes probably made a mistake
My office is literally the only place this address could possibly be
I don't know who the fuck S Atkinson is
And the courier is a retard if they give it to a random person instead of the receptionist
They had better compensate me if they lost the parcel
So I don't lose money from it
If I have to buy the same product again but can't find it at such a low price, I'm going to be pissed
Gonna have to spend £150 for a product which I initially only paid £50 for
scan.co.uk
Pretty good retailer AFAIK
yeah but they might only compensate me for £50 because it's a refurbished model
And now it's out of stock, so I'd have to pay £100 for the brand new one
I'd be fine with that. The reviews of the refurbished one say that it's as good as new, so I thought it's great value for £50, but unopened probably has a way better warranty
Luckily I don't need it until my Ncase M1 arrives in like a month from now anyway
What?
£50
Yeah they go for ~£100 I think
Good idea, if I can find a used one
Ebay fees will eat into the profit though
I think all the factory refurbished ones are off the market now, so you can't get a cheap one any more
Yeah I can't get a cheap refurbished one any more
:(
They were going for £50 on ebay and scan and they were in amazing condition according to reviews
Ohhhhh that's a good idea

lmao Google
wtf it says "Return to sender requested" now
I forgot to bring my headphones into work too
Only have my SE215s and DT770s today :(
Why the fuck does it say "Return to sender requested" ?
I didn't request that
What is Scan going to do? They are not the delivery company
It's Hemes's fault!!!
I can't phone them now because I am at work
I don't want my manager to think I'm slacking by taking personal calls
lmao it's terrible
What I find most dumb about it is that London has no residents all of a sudden
As soon as the bombs go off, London becomes a ghost town
Have you seen Olympus Has Fallen? That film was a fucking masterpiece
Yeah and the police are absent during the whole film lmao
Why are you watching London Has Fallen instead of going to work?
wow the £ is up a lot today
Or maybe the $ is just down a lot
Isn't she a really vile person?
I love how evil women are taking over Western politics. Hillary Clinton, Teresa May, Angela Eagle lmao
She's a fucking racist bitch
She'll beat Corbyn if they don't put him on the ballot
Or she'll take over because she'll be the only person on the ballot
Even though Corbyn was the democratically elected leader
Why is she such an evil person?
She wants to get rid of her rightful leader just because she thinks she can do a better job herself, even though nobody voted for her in the leadership election?!??!?
wtf is the point in a leadership election if the MPs can just overthrow someone?
 Why doesn't the PLP just ban the LP from voting then?
Well you can let them vote for MPs but not the leader
Like the conversation party do
Seems to work well for them
Nobody complains when a new PM comes along that the public isn't allowed to vote for
Now that Teresa May is PM, it might be a good time to buy a PIA subscription
£2.53 a month
Shit, have they?
I thought they had servers all around the globe though?
The Russian Government would only be able to get at the Russian servers
The annoying thing about using a VPN is that I'll have to disable it most of the time so I can play videogames anyway
??????????
wtf you used MSN when you were doing A Levels?
Wasn't MSN dead back then?
I just use WhatsApp nowadays
How old are you?
lmao
Do you believe in global warming?
Doom has Vulkan now
Like Dota
I watched it last night
Fuck it's so long
Batman vs Superman is shit because the most likeable character is killed off about 1/3 of the way through the film
Oh shit sorry
My bad
Forgot you haven't seen it yet
wtf Iam the youngest?
Yeah but yours is better than mine
I wish my gf had as much money as me, we'd get such a good mortgage
No, because she has no money
What does ctrl+Q do?
Happy Prime Day
yes
11/07/2016  17:35  Return to sender requested
What's the difference between HD600 and HD650, and which is better?
I'm trying on these earbuds which came with my Vodafone lmao
They have like zero isolation
They sound really bad, but usable for free I guess
You get what you pay for
650 are V-shaped?
I'm not going to get them, but I've seen the Fidelio
Seen the Fidelio X2 compared to 650 saying "650 but cheaper"
Why?
My reasons for wanting to own AKG K702 were specific to that model
HD600 sound like shit compared to the HD800
But I don't want to spend more than £150 on a pair of headphones because I don't think the marginal improvement to sound quality is worth the money
The law of diminishing returns is very real with headphones
Yeah but Fidelio X2 are just as good or even better than HD600?
Fidelio X2 is endgame AFAIK?
Philips doesn't have as good brand reputation
I only know about the Fidelio X2, IDK what else they make
The Fidelio X2 has unrivalled bass for a high-end open headphone
And they have a single removable 32ohm 3.5mm jack
So it's unique in its portability and versatility for a very high-end pair of headphones
You can get a V-Moda Boompro and turn it into a gaming headset
lmao that talent-less hillbilly
lmao why would I be jealous of her? My gf is much more beautiful
omg I'm really concerned about my pension because of the letter I just received
The letter told me that when I retire I will get an annual pension of £6,400
Even though I am contributing the maximum of 17% of my salary, I'm still going to retire into poverty wtf
Why the fuck is my pension amount so low when I am contributing so much
?
Context?
Not really funny, people walk in the wrong direction and need to 180 sometimes
Usually whilst not trying to spy on everyone though
My colleague is playing Pokemon Go
She told me she's a nerd
Has anyone else seen Batman vs Superman?
Sometimes I talk on the phone whilst taking a dump
Because if I have to call them back, I'll be put on hold for ages and have to go through security questions
Just spoke to Scan
They're gonna contact Hermes for me
Hermes definitely fucked up
How do I profit from being 25?
Yeah when I was 10 I was dirt poor
I only had what was given to me
Scan say my CPU cooler is on the way back to them and they'll get it within 48 hours. They asked me if I want it shipped back to me
The £ has risen a fuckload today
Fucking sellout http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36777424
I hope the £ goes high because I like to buy lots of foreign expensive shit
You around? I need you quickly
Need your help
I think I might buy the Etymotic e4rs
"outstanding isolation" according to Head-Fi
Do you ever clean your IEMs?
LMAO Corbyn is on the ballot
So fucking pointless
Now the leader won't change
 Wouldn't that decrease the chance of the result changing?
The last election was about 8-10 months ago I think?
If we're gonna have a second election to change the labour PM, should we have a second election to change the EU result too?
Why is Corbyn not a leader and
unelectable?
I keep hearing "not a leader" and "unelectable" but no actual facts behind it
If you love him so much, then why don't you marry him?
What law?
lmao why?
But will she roll back the whole gamers online gaming law?
I hope she doesn't make intraracial marriage illegal too
wtf? http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-36775398
lmao sure
I saw Batman vs Superman and it was awful
Do you ever use closed headphones at home, or just your HD600?
At home I use a combination of my COP and K702
omg it's been over a year since I've been ill now
And that was just a cold
So I've been really healthy for the past year
Even though I never visit doctorsa
doctors*
Do you never need any isolation at home then?
I would just use my COP at work, but sometimes it's very noisy at home
And sometimes I play music at night
wow lucky
lmao why did you live with Serotone?
Don't be creepy please
Is Excercise good for the immune system? I have not been ill since I started exercising
Maybe it's just a coincidence
I might bid on these http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Great-Sounding-Philips-Fidelio-X2-Sound-Of-Sennheiser-HD650-for-less-/222178473214?hash=item33bade74fe:g:YiMAAOSwEjFXfRdA
Sound of Sennheiser HD650 for less
wat
Wanna buy my Beyerdynamic DT770s?
When will batteries be invented with more recharge cycles and higher capacities?
Because electric cars would really take off if batteries were better
And laptops/smartphones would be so much better
wtf only £400?
I have like £10,000 in current accounts
I think I'm going to aim to keep a constant 5-6k emergency savings after I have my house
Would be a nice safety net
Will allow me to pay the mortgage for a few months until I find another job if I ever get sacked
Why?
Why do you need to stay comfortbale?
fucking love exbc
Too late, I've moved on to WhatsApp
And even Steam chat
Not a fan of Facebook
I'm a bit worried that every season of Robot Wars the robots will continue to evolve and eventually they'll become the ultimate killing machines
Just bought Philips Fidelio X2 on ebay for £127
Won the auction
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/phillips-fidelio-x2-WOOX-with-foult-see-description-/302006605604?autorefresh=true&nma=true&si=BGYCB7sNQrk4orIyyAvW7HlCVTE%253D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2557
?
I thought you wanted to know what I think of the Philips Fidelio X2?
I thought you were interested in them?
I bought Philips Fidelio X2
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/phillips-fidelio-x2-WOOX-with-foult-see-description-/302006605604?autorefresh=true&nma=true&si=BGYCB7sNQrk4orIyyAvW7HlCVTE%253D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2557
What do you think?
Good price for £127?
I'm creating an ebay listing for my DT770s
How's this? http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/-/222185533644?
Is my listing okay? http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/-/222185533644?
I don't need DT770 now that my Custom One Pro fills that niche for me
Having both is excessive
I might sell my M50X too if you're interested?
And my Shure SE215
No, that was my old gaming headset
I binned it
It was in such bad condition
I keep all my headphones in very good condition now
The headset had all its leather falling off
Functioned perfectly, but it looked like shit
omfg Fund TDF (2056-2058) has changed +8.4% from 12/04/2016 to 08/07/2016.
Well we're fucked now https://liberty.e-activist.com/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1826&ea.campaign.id=44061
https://youtu.be/D2fSXp6N-vs
She sounds like a fucking dictator
I feel like shit today
My head feels heavy
At work?
I got some Beechams instead
My colleague was playing it a few days ago
Sounds like he thinks democracy shouldn't apply because he has money?
Yeah they should just support their elected leader or fuck off
They're making themselves look like authoritarians
I thought that they were Nuw Labour?
But isn't the PLP supposed to represent the labour party?
Well they're doing a fucking bad job atm
It's sad that the Conversative party is becoming the only relevant UK party though
Yeah she only wants to spy on everyone
I'm thinking about subscribing to PIA
Yeah
The only thing stopping me is that I CBA to turn it on and off every time I play a game
It's not ideal for online gaming because it increases latency
Because I want it to apply to Bittorrent and other things as well
Possibly, but I CBA to put lots of work into setting it up and then maintain it
That's about £2.50 a month?
There's a really good VPN comparison spreadsheet
The PIA Android client blocks ads too
My £127 Philips Fidelio X2 has been dispatched by ebay ^^
£127
They might be faulty though...
What is cp?
HP=Hit Points
Is Pokemon Go like the Gameboy Pokemon games?
Know someone who might be interested in my headphones? http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Beyerdynamic-DT-770-PRO-80Ohms-pleather-pads-/222185533644
They're good headphones
I recommend you buy them
Stop looking at batteries and buy some decent headphones ffs
Why?
I might do
Should I put it at 99p starting bid?
I got my Philips Fidelio X2 for £127
Why?
Is the max auction length 7 days?
I sniped my Philips Fidelio X2
£127
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/302006605604?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT
The customer returned this head phones saing
Unfortunately, there's a missmatch in the drivers, and the right side is about 4db louder in certain sections in the bass [60hz and bellow] and throughout the midrange [2 - 6Khz], 
I tryed to test it my self hearing music and using SineGen,also i give to my freand,but can't spot any thing wrong.How ever since there was a complain and i feel that he is  honest person i must sell it as foulty.
Yeah that's what I thought, but I'll test it myself
I can always just return it or get Philips to repair it, right?
haha I was thinking that too
Could probably get like £160 for them
Maybe more
I hope they are okay though, because I want to use these headphones
They're my endgame headphones
For only £127!!!
Fucking cheap as fuck endgame headphones
Yeah or he's drunk/on drugs
There's a lot of other mistakes on that page
lmao?
He's an active ebay seller and knows how to test headphones with Sinegen
I don't think he's mentally disabled, just bad at English
I'll be so happy if they work properly
Endgame headphones for only £127 would be amazing
Cheaper than a brand new pair of Custom One Pros!
Can't believe I got my Custom One Pro for only £74.63 too
I found a 250ohm DT770 with removeable 3.5mm port for a fair price on ebay last night
I really need to stop spending all my money
Nintendo should just launch an official emulator with all the games included
lmao I installed Tor Browser on my friend's computer and he got really upset and his friends freaked out and threatened to kill me
was really weird
Should I write to Tesco and tell them that their employee threatened me?
lmao some 25 stone man threatened to kill me last night after I installed Tor Browser on his friend's computer
Wanted to go on the darkweb to browse drug marketplaces
Yeah but my friend does
IDK maybe he thinks TOR is scary and illegal
No idea
Don't give out contact information of dealers, and don't link to, or mention the names of any specific darknet markets.
wtf I'm allowed to mention specific darknet markets now?
niceeeeeeeee
Too bad I don't use any
Why?
My friend kicked me out of his party because I offered to show him how to order drugs on the darknet lmao
I would like to smoke weed too
Did you know that in  America you can buy weed from highstreet retailers?
Me too
I don't smoke weed because I have other things to spend my time and money on at the moment
Like headphones and video games
And because I'm a designated driver almost every day
lmao same
But I do more fun stuff at night
I heard that working in Japan is a good way to meet fit grills
Because Japan is a working culture and the company finds you a gf
Yeah fuck that
Well yeah, you spend the time meeting grills
I work 8 hours a day, and even that seems too much
I don't think so, but they aren't too bad
Don't really know them very well though
I've never had a Japanese gf
I put £500 a month into the Nationwide 5% regular saver
It's a really fucking good account
Yeah
And it's more flexible than most others too
I missed it at first too
I think you can withdraw and overdeposit to it too
It's a really nice account http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/best-regular-savings-accounts#bb
You can make unlimited withdrawals from the account. If you do take cash  out, you can pay back in during the same month provided your net  increase  isn't more than £500. 
Doesn't look like there's any penalty
I'm making >5% interest on £10,000 atm
The problem is that I'm going to have to spend about £15,000 on a house next year
And my pension is growing by 8.1%!
17% of my salary goes into my pension
7% from me, 10% from my company
But they're thinking of extending it up to 10% and 15%
Which I'll definitely be taking advantage of
Because I want to buy lots of Hi-Fi headphones when I'm a pensioner
Are you a mod on /r/uktrees?
Why thai?
you'll have plenty of money to pick up thai prozzies in retirement davehamil 
You seem to know a lot more about it than I do
lmao why?
wtf that's rude
Me too, if she was Korean
Oh shit HIV?!?!?
I've had unprotected sexual intercourse too, should I get myself tested?
wtf
Isn't that illegal?
Yeah but it's very illegal, right?
How many years in jail do you get for doing that? 10+ probably?
...
When someone says "I am now away from the business" does that mean they've left the company or they're just on leave?
He's not responding to my emails
It's so ambigious
He's probably not even aware of my existance
No
NSFW!!!!!!
Do you like the new OW hero?
?
What are you talking about?
Even if your team already has 5 widows?
4 then
Do you pick widow even when there are much better options?
wtf I have ear pain
I think I have an ear infection or some shit
I think I have Pulsatile Tinnitus
omg it hurts so much
I think I'm dying
OMG IT HURTS SO MUCH
Terry Crews just built a really powerful PC
Wanna buy some really nice headphones?
Why would I have IDE cables in my PC?
Oh shit, my ear just made a weird noise
I think my eardrum may have perfurated or something
Maybe it will relieve the pressure inside my head
The pain has reduced a bit
ffs it's so fucking annoying
Rebecca Black uses the same headphones as us https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beNuHbuXtkA
lmao
White people are racist trash http://mirror.ninja/c5ry
Yeah CS:GO could really use it
CS:GO is in bad need of a new client
CS:GO's client is fucking terrible
32bit is dead
Why is that a shame?
Yeah they're filthy casuals
Pus is coming out of my ear wtf
I think the built-up fluid stuck behind my ear drum is starting to cum out
Hopefully most of the pain will subside by bedtime
"pain and crying usually last for several hours" http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/ear-infection/ear-infections-what-happens
Would it be a good idea to rupture the eardrum manually?
ffs I'm dead in my left ear
deaf*
wtf the same guy I bought my Fidelio X2 from just listed another pair with the same problem http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/302014878080
Does that seem fishy?
? It's stil there
How do I get a tax refund?
I'm worried I might have underpaid income tax
Because I kept being given Universal Credit even when employed for some reason
And the banks gave me shitloads of money
Someone just offered £85 including postage and packaging for my DT770s, should I accept it?
lmao this guy
"Hi Sam
Sorry  about my original derisory offer. I was perusing looking for something  just right and saw yours. I made the offer and thought WTF was I  thinking. I didnt expect you to accept. I should have put £75 initially  and the only reason I have is because your charging £10 carriage and at  £95 with £10 carriage I could get a new unit. Hope you smiled when you  saw my mistake and called me a cheeky bugger lol. 
Best Wishes
Keven"
I'm probably going to do this as an auction
I've listed my DT770s
Last chance to buy my DT770s for cheap, you want them?
I'm deaf in one ear now
I hope it's not permanent
I had an ear infection and I think my ear drum got perforated and now I have deafness and tinnitus
IDK whether I should drive to work tomorrow
I'm really worried about taking sick leave because I don't want to get in trouble
Does ear infection count as sick?
I know a cold doesn'tr
But a coma does
So what counts and what doesn't?
I don't want to take days off sick then my manager tells me I'm well enough to work and then I get into trouble
Do you think this will sell? http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/222189823650?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649
I put the condition as "Seller refurbished" and mentioned that I added brand new earpads
I walked out in front of a car because I didn't hear it coming
And I almost walked into a couple of people at the supermarket
I rely on my hearing so much
hey
I'm going to get some legally prescribed drugs today called antibiotics
Oh shit, do I have to pay for prescriptions in England?
fuck
Forgot about that
hahahahaha our CEO just walked past my desk
I don't think deafness and tinnitus is a good enough reason to skip work
And an ear infection
I need to save my sick days for when I get REALLY ill
Because I'm desperate not to become unemployed
This is my first 'real' job
ffs this tinnitus is FUCKING ANNOYING
Got some fucking ear pain too
fuck, the other person in charge of managing our procurement system is going on leave all week
And I need to cover for her

AT THIS RATE MY NCASE M1 WILL ARRIVE BEFORE MY CORSAIR H105
Why?
Okay so why won't Hermes deliver my parcels to me?
Why are those the magic words?
What would you do in my situation?
ffs I was slacking off at work and now my mum has come home to annoy me
I was going to watch a film or something
omg that was some nice icecream
omg you can get 10TB HDDs now
That's more space than I'll ever need
wow you can get a 3TB HDD for £64 now
ffs this medication is irritating my stomach
Yes
FUCK GLOBAL WARMING
32C here right now
The hottest temperature ever recorded in the UK was 38.5C (101.3F) in Faversham, Kent, in August 2003.
I can't go outside because I'd literally get sunburnt within a few minutes....
I bet if I went into my office today I'd be too cold because our air conditioning is overpowered
wow in the period of about a minute, some DT770s went up from £46 to £75 on an ebay auction
In fact, I think they went up from £46 to £75 in about 10 seconds
This is gonna be nervewracking on Sunday
I'm either gonna sell my DT770s for £46 or for £75+
FUCK TINNITUS
FUCK THIS STUPID SHIT

Virgin is for virgins
That's ancient now
CoD4 is dead
It was good but not great
Yes
I was enjoying other FPS games more
Like Quake and UT
I liked to play BF2142 too
I played a lot of very old shooters for a long time
Didn't like post-Xbox 360 shooters
Have you played Ana yet?
I like Ana more because I don't have to wait for the snipper to charge
hahahhaa yeah me too
It's so weird when you're trying to kill someone and you accidentally heal someone instead
It's a shame she can't ult herself
What if you're the last one alive on defenders overtime?
Nobody picks Bastion any more
His ult isn't very good anyway
Fuck disabled people http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/video_and_audio/headlines/36839725
lmao they actually said that?
yay gone up to £16 now http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/222189823650
FUCK SUMMER
I'm deaf and have tinnitus now just because people come into the office when they are ill
I hope it's temp
God made you suffer for a reason, so you have no excuse
You should be grateful for my presence
Tinnitus?
Have you experienced tinnitus before?
Wow it sold at only £117 http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/phillips-fidelio-x2-WOOX-with-possible-foult-see-description/302014878080?_trksid=p5411.c100167.m2940&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20140131123730%26meid%3Db063a3ae628340febef5ab5f45223243%26pid%3D100167%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D14%26sd%3D302006605604&autorefresh=true

Was on the phone to them, then BT cut me off because I reached my maximum spend cap
Cost me £5 to call Amazon wtf
Tried three browsers, stil can't get it to work
4 browsers
? BT cut me off because I spent too much money
Can't believe that Amazon phone call cost me £5
Why does Amazon charge me to call them wtf
There's no warning about it either
My mum is going to be pissed next time she gets a phone bill
Amazon customer support is a bit shitty today
They have the weirdest fucking accents
Can't understand them
ffs this is the second time Amazon is replacing my Corsair K65 keyboard
It's a really really nice keyboard
I might just be getting unlucky with some bad batches
The look and feel is amazing
I'm going to get a new mouse within a year I think
Mice have gotten expensive
High-end gaming mice used to only be £20-£30 and now they're like £50-£70 wtf
lmao weighted mice are so dumb

Wanna buy some DT770s with new EDT 770 SG earpads?
Cloudy drink kills frog
Can I package my headphones with newspaper?
I should have taken the £85 offer. I only got £73 from the auction :(
omg
I wish they'd send me a cheque too
But they'll probably just ask me for money
I got lots of in-work benefits
They kept giving me my dole even though I was working
Best of both worlds
Free money and a job
Yes and I have a Korean gf
Can I use newspaper to pack my items for my ebay sellers?

What's your Steam username? I will call you tonight
I'm going home at 14:00
Gonna collect some drugs on the way home
Going to Boots
HOLY FUCK THAT WAS THE NASTIEST TASTING PILL I'VE EVER EATEN
I'm supposed to swallow it
But swallowing is hard
Can Clarithromycin Tablets Film-Coated be dissolved in Dr Pepper?
Congratgs
What is it?
https://i.redd.it/55qoiqoj8dbx.png
YES MY PARCEL IS UNDER 1KG
NOW I CAN SEND IT FOR CHEAPER
I think it was only 12m
And I think the subscription was cheaper in China
So I have this crushed up tablet with me today
And some Marmite and a can of Dr Pepper
No, it's in a cup
Gonna do it in the kitchen in case I need to throw up in the sink
When you swallow pills, are you just supposed to relax your throat and let gravity do the job, or are you supposed to use your throat muscles?
brb reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing
fuck this is complicated
I can drink water
The problem is that the powder I am mixing into the water makes it taste LIKE FUCKING SHIT
Can I come too?
nice
Where is it?
where the fuck is that?
Is that near New York?
Because the north is shit
I watched Grimsby last night
Was it a wet dream?
Eventually my Fidelio X2 will arrive
Once MyHermes sorts out their shit
I already did
I upgraded my Fiio E10K to Creative E5
Yes of course it's an upgrade
 Get an Ncase
https://www.ncases.com/
Mine will arrive next month some time probably
Unless MyHermes fucks up again
The best way to stop people stealing your PC is to buy a couple of defective consoles on ebay and putting them in the same room as your PC
I already have a GTX 970 I will put in there
If I insure my PC, will they actually pay me £1,500 if someone steals it?
Or will they just replace it with a shitty Dell?
 That's a lot of work
That sucks
wtf fires definitely happen m9
wtf no it's not
My PC costs over £1,000
fuck you
Grimsby is pretty bad
I didn't like some of the sexual jokes
And all the swearing
And Sasha Baron Cohen looking horribly out of shape
I watched Planet of the Apes too
Alright, gonna go do some drugs then maybe throw up
I can't do it...
I'm too scared
Gonna try again with some apple sauce later
I'm so upset
My parents never taught me how to swallow pills
I hate this illness so much
And I hate antibiotics
Why not?

So?
Will you go to Asia and find an Asian gf?
Sure
I told them yesterday
Yes
I don't want to stay here
Earn more money
wtf
You're not going to China or Korea?!??!?
Oh sorry, I missed it
Sounds good then
Will you meet lots of Chinese girls in China?
I am cash and time poor :(
NICE!!!!
I can go buy a £10,000 car without financing tomorrow if I wanted to
Just because I can, doesn't mean I should
I need to buy a house ASAP so I can live with my Korean gf
My gf is 30 and I'm 24....
Still don't have enough for a mortgage for 100% of a property
But she doesn't speak much English good
IDK a couple of years
It's easier for Germans to learn English than it is for Korean
Yes and Korean girls are really attractive
Sacha Baron Cohen in Grimsby reminds me of you
Obsession with fat girls
It's weird and unhealthy
My gf always tells me she's fat wtf
I think she's just attention seeking

WHERE THE FUCK ARE MYHERMES PARCELS
01/07/2016  23:49  Order placed
lmao
ARE YOU FUCKING BUSY M9
HR is full of girls
wtf are you talking about
What does "slick corp" "onboarding process" "personal insult" and "armchair psychologist" mean?
wtf is a jobsworth
Stop using weird jargon
Is she Asian?
What do you think is the best newspaper, Sun, BILD or Daily Mail?
Have you met any Asian girls playing Pokemon Go yet?
What sort of strats?
You're in your 30s but you play a videogame designed for children lmao
You should be a social conformist, drink beer, and watch football
Yeah but you don't watch football
It's got some really good reviews
It's got a lot of negative reviews from misgonists
missogynists
masojonists?
masoganists
How the fuck do you spell it
It's hard to say too
I think there might be a silent d in there too
misdgonysts
Zootopia is really fucking good
It has a female lead
But misogonists like it too
wtf it's on Popcorn Time right now
Yes it's amazing
Did you know that the original story for Zootopia was that predators had to wear collars to inhibit their emotions?
But it was decided that the story was too dark, so instead predators just evolved out of predatoring
I'm going to try putting my antibiotics in fruit juice

Wanna buy my M50X?
Barely used
I would keep them, but I'm not satisfied with the isolation, and prefer the sound of my Beyer Custom One Pros a lot more
I just wish my Custom One Pros would fold up into a tiny shape like my M50X
It's my only complaint with these headphones
Because they're really nice
With the DT770 pads
Super comfy, sound great, replaceable pads and headband, removeable cable, customisable bass port
Absolute fucking bargain for £74.63
You can get custom faceplates too, but I probably won't bother with that
Anyeoung hasseyo
Are you a grill?
I like Chinese too
She's fat, so you can have her
I have a gf too
I met her on the internet
I met mine on okc too
Met a couple of other grills too before her
wtf why you get so sweaty?
You could make it even worse by mixing in some of the antibiotics I'm taking
I heard girls like sweaty men anyway
My friend told me that girls like men when they get all sweaty in the gym
But only when they're getting sweaty, not after they've been all sweaty
I hate sweating, but this weather makes me sweat :(
Thankfully it's a bit cooler today
Fuck the sun
The sun burns me so bad
If I was president, I would blow up the son
Ohhhh that's a good idea
He basically built the world's largest parasol
To keep everyone cool in the shade
What other channel?
Have they been disabled so that you can get high?
Do you live in a flat?
What is that like? Do you pay service charges and live with lots of people?
Yeah but you live in a block of flats with other people?
What is your rent then?
HOLY SHIT
That's fucking expensive m9
You must be filthy rich m9
How can you afford to buy new headphones and upgrade your PC every month if you're paying so much in rent?
Sure
I have a healthy Korean gf and better headphones than you, so I think I'm doing just fine m9
Around £1246
30k net holy shit
I would upgrade my PC every week if I had 30k net salary
I want to get an i7 6700k but I can't afford one :(
I just hope I still have a job in 10 years
wtf is doss
IDK robots are taking my jobs
I should get a job in the automation industry
I want robots to take my job but not my income
But they'll probably just take my job

Pokemon Go is fucking dangerous https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PLGk7Jdg3c
Because there's a fuckload more dangerous people in USA
Everyone has guns, so the police need to be better armed
It feels a lot safer in the UK where most people don't have guns and most police don't either
Yeah and a really fucking nice rig too
No stupid sponsored shit gear
Sponsored gear = bad gear
Yeah IDK if any of the fatal1ty gear was any good
Yeah like K702 and K65 and EC1A and i7 6700k and GTX 1080
And he's black
It's 60hz though...
He should have got the Z35 200hz
His son is a fucking noob
Holy shit Terry Crews is ripped
10 year olds can be better than you expect

Terry Crews has spent a fucking shitload on that system
Even wealthier than rory?

PLEASE GIVE ME MY SHIT MYHERMES
FUCK ANTIBIOTICS
Stop trolling
It's not funny to joke about peoples' health
Would I actually die if I didn't take my antibiotics though?
Wouldn't my body just fight off the infection?
Can I play video games whilst on IV?
No, but I may be at some point in my life
wtf you used to have a gf that had cancer?
Would you dump her after she got cancer?
Would you dump a grill after she gets cancer?
The NHS won't get better unless the government changes
Cancer rates may change 30 years from now
Were you able to play videogames when you were on IV?
That's not how it works omg
So you would dump a grill after she gets cancer?
Wouldn't you be worried about your reputation if you did that?
People would think you're a horrible person for dumping someone for their cancer
Nice to know you have no conscience m9
Can people on cancer still have sex?
lmao my colleague has been on the phone for the past 20 minutes trying to fix a problem I know the solution for
I try to get her attention to tell her I know how to fix it, but she tells me she's too busy trying to fix the problem to talk to me right now lmao
I don't think anything could possibly taste worse than my antibiotics
I CANT SWALLOW THEM OMG
 Probably if I find a sharp knife
I don't like light bodyweight exercise
I like to lift heavy
I'm doing Dr Pepper right now
Dr Pepper has acid in it
Na, drugs are for losers
What about Lastpass?
When is Keepass getting cloud servers?
The autosyncing is really handy
Keepass is a pain to use
IIRC the main thing I disliked about Keepass was the inability to add passwords into apps on Android
Also, Keepass keeps locking
Granted, LastPassâ€™s implementation of autofill in browser is much better and it even lets you do that in apps (check out the video below to see how it all works). KeePass is cumbersome but free.
If you only want something to store passwords securely and you absolutely need to access them on mobile devices, but can do without the autofill functionality, go with KeePass.
If you like your stuff to work without you having to tinker and customize it endlessly, go for LastPass.
Oh, you want the same no-nonsense solution on mobile as well. And you donâ€™t mind paying $12 for a worthy service? Sign up for LastPass then.
Don't you have to enter your Keepass password every time you start up your PC?
lmao so you have to keep entering your password all day
LastPass is easier
Yeah but Keepass is less secure than not storing your passwords electronically
It's a trade-off of convenience and security
Post its on their monitor is fucking retarded
You'd get sacked for doing stupid shit like that
At almost any company
It defeats the fucking point of even having a password
You'd have to question their intelligence to do their job though
I don't use post-its, I just use electronic notes
We don't have onenote, so I use the sticky notes
I have OneNote at home because I pirated it
And I did other illegal things too
If a girl has STDs, how do I make her pregnant without catching anything?

Do we need TV licenses to watch Twitch?
wtf if I save in my personal pension, then I will become ineligible for a government pension?
If I save heavily into my work pension, will that make me ineligible for my state pension?
Funds
FUNDS YOU ARE INVESTED IN
TDF (2056-2058) 10.7% (1 year actual growth)
omg
10.7% growth wtf
Yeah wtf
And 17% of my salary goes into it too
You pay 7.00% of your benefit salary, your company adds 10.00% of your benefit salary
2%?
So 4% in total?
That's so much lower than my 17%
Are you getting a good rate at least?
I'm getting 10.7% atm
IDK when I'm retire though. I might retire at 55 or I might retire at 70
Maybe even higher than 70...
I'd quite like to have money and not work though
But what if my gaming PC is already fully upgraded, what will I spend my money on?
There's a limit to how much performance money can buy
The best CPU (i7 6700k) is only like £250-£300
I'd rather have a fat salary too
But my pension plan is definitely worth investing into
7%+10%*10.7% is pretty sweet
If I had this pension plan but with a £500k salary, I'd be a billionnaire when I retire
If you're a billionaire then you don't have to pay tax
I think universal basic income will probably exist before I retire
ANYEOUNG HASSEYO
Fuck, I forgot to keep my prescription receipts
I need to claim the money back
From my health plan
nvm I checked the health plan and I don't think it covers prescriptions :(
 wtf you talk about corbyn a lot, do you fancy him or something?
When is the vote going ahead?
I want to see how the MPs react when Corbyn gets voted in again
Are they going to keep saying "not a leader"?
The MPs seem a bit antidemocratic
That's even more undemocratic...
The donor is not representative democracy

I'm looking forward to the dramqa
s/dramqa/drama/
Corbyn is going to be re-elected then all the MPs will be shitters
Saying he's not a leader and he didn't deserve to be elected and he's unelectable or some shit
I've noticed that they've changed their wording from "unelectable" to "not a leader" I wonder why that is
Did they change it because the election is coming and they don't want to look stupid?
I wonder what they'll come up with next
They'll choose a new criticism probably
https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwittIenq5bOAhWlZpoKHQzLAxIQFgg2MAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnewsthump.com%2F2016%2F07%2F26%2Funelectable-man-to-win-election%2F&usg=AFQjCNGf1aB-R3RJXY5-kUiThfR46zBv9g&sig2=4dDY9_XBDY3c6Wpf9_4aIg
http://newsthump.com/2016/07/26/unelectable-man-to-win-election/
Why do they have to shout so much and make so many personal attacks in parliament too?
They're not very professional, they would get sacked if they did this at any other workplace
And why did David Cameron tell Corbyn to resign wtf
They're all a bunch of twats
Why?
Okay then
Holy fuck I got downvoted so hard for saying I like bacon sandwiches on /r/vegan
They're such fascists in there
They hate people with an alternate opinion
They think they're better than us because they don't eat meet wtf
How do you know?
FUCK MYHERMES
They failed to deliver again today wtf
It's the easiest fucking place to find and there's always someone at reception
But no, they somehow fuck it up and I am seriously inconvenienced
They really are shit
Shit customer support too. They don't take phone calls wtf
Scan will send my parcel back to me with DPD (once MyHermes eventually returns it to them) and I have requested my ebay seller change the deliver address to my grandparents
They don't warn you before they turn up either, so I'd have to sit at home for days waiting for it
I don't think Scan will invoice me
My ebay seller might, I haven't received a response yet
oh wow he just responded, that was fast!
As our couriers are self-employed they are not obliged to leave a contact number.
poor pay 47 pence a parcels and you had to pay for fuel running costs ect
They only want to empower people...... to whip them when they get it wrong, training is to expensive due to budgets. Top managers are clueless talk is very cheap within the management.
Self-employed position but treated like employed without the benefits! Told what to do, rubbish pay and no negotiation
Rubbish company, having to go to small claim court to get a weeks pay
DPD>MyHermes
Never had a problem with DPD
I've never NOT had a problem with MyHermes
MyHerpes are hands down the worst delivery firm I've had the mid pleasure of dealing with
Is it rude to ignore someone talking to me when I've just answered the phone a second before they started talking? I was told I'm very rude today
What takes priority, the person sitting next to me that I can get back to as soon as my phone call has finished, or the person calling me who I don't know when I can get back to them?
why?
Why?
fuck MyHermes
My ebay seller is asking me wtf is going on
They attempted to deliver at 09:17 yesterday but told me they couldn't because of a "security issue" wtf?
The building was open and the reception was staffed
LMAO
They won't let me call them
The answer machine just tells me to use their webchat
It's Hermes that's fucking up though. They haven't delivered my scan.co.uk parcel either
They're fucking up my deliveries AND I CANT UNDERSTAND WHY
K65 is good
Or K70
Anything with Cherry MX Red because it's best for gaming
Maybe look at blues/browns for typing
Read this http://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/
Reds make a noise
They aren't silent
It's been a month since Hermes got my scan.co.uk parcel
I think they're going to take it back to Scan who will send it with DPD insteaed
Amazon had to send me that keyboard three times
The first time it didn't sit level, the second time it kept dying on me
I've just got my third one, so hopefully it works fine now
Yeah or maybe I was just unlucky
It's a really nice keyboard though
IDK about production/serial number
Yes the K65
Non-LED
MX Red
"i am sorry about it i use a lot hermes 98% it is good but not always.If there will be a problem with new address i will ask to bring it back and send it with diferent curier."
Yeah I explained that I'm having problems with Hermes with other parcels
My office is the easiest fucking place to deliver to. It's the only large office in the area, the only building with this post code, and reception is always staffed
The courier is just incompotent
I just sent my DT770s with MyHermes, I hope they don't fuck it up
Hermes is going to deliver to my grandparents' house, but I'm a bit worried about that. My grandfather might not be at home at the random time they choose to deliver, and they might be too impatient to wait for him to answer the door.
My grandmother is too disabled to answer the door
Don't buy that
I know a lot about which mice are good and which are not
So I'd strongly advise you seek my advice before making a purchase
 Mouse prices have gone up a lot in the past couple of years. High-end mice used to be £30 but now they're like £50-£60
Try to find one with a 3310 sensor
Razer's production quality is poor
They spend more on marketing then engineering
Zowie mice are all fantastic
Logitech mice are often very good too
Not sure on prices, but make sure you get one with a 3310 or 3360 sensor without any stupid gimmicks
I bought my mouse about 6 years ago, Logitech replaced it a couple of times
Logitech has low click latency, good sensors and good build quality
And good support
But they've started putting stupid gimmicks in their latest mice
Like weights and sniper buttons
I think so. Check out ebay or massdrop or mouse spec spreadsheets or buying guides
You'll probably find something
np let me know what you're gonna buy
I think I'm going to upgrade my mouse later this year
I'll probably get a Zowie or maybe the Finalmouse Scream One if it is any good
I have a Logitech G400s
Named after ScreaM a pro CS:GO player
I'm generally put off by sponsored products though
Good products, like Beyerdynamic headphones, Zowie mice, etc, don't put names on their products and focus on good engineering instead
But the Scream One sounds promising
I want to get a 3360 sensor mouse, but there aren't many available atm
I don't mind not receiving my Corsair H100 for a month because I need my Ncase M1 first
It'll probably get to me within a couple of weeks
s/H100/H105/
And my ears have been fucked up so I can't enjoy my Fidelio X2 anyway
So although Hermes is FUCKING SHIT STUPID USELESS CUNTS, it hasn't actually affected me that much
Anyone buy a GTX 970 recently? Get £55 for free https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4v5dqd/if_you_bought_a_gtx_970_from_amazon_you_are/
I bought mine from overclockers.co.uk though :(
Is Lawbreakers any good?
I think it will flop hard
Arena FPS is dead
MyHermes is going to deliver my buyer's DT770s today. I think they don't fuck it up like they always do to my parcels
Good luck m9
I wish I was paid 10 times as much as I currently am
Then I could buy a house
No, some people earn more than 10 times what I currently am
So they would not want to earn that much
No not really, there's a growing class of mega rich and they certainly don't want to lose the majority of their income
I wouldn't mind losing the majority of a billionnaire's income, sounds fun!
As long as it's not my own wealth
haha I used to think that's how tax brackets worked when I was like 10
I realised it years before I started paying tax
When I was asking my primary school teacher about his salary and tax brackets, he didn't correct me
wtf how does he not understand tax brackets then?
lmfao srsly?
Did he never look at his payslips?
I hate how Windoze manages software updates
It's so disorganised and chaotic
Delivered - package posted in letterbox
HOW THE FUCK
DID MY DT770S FIT THROUGH THE LETTERBOX
It was one I sent
Not the ones I'm waiting for
But wtf how can DT770s fit through a letterbox
I might check with my ebay buyer that Hermes hasn't fucked it up somehow
I don't trust them
I have put another auction up http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/-/222197590925?
An old ass fuck graphics card
Might still get a few £ for it though
Might try to sell my old digital camera too
You'd be better off with integrated graphics than that card
Integrated graphics are fine for media centres nowadays
Are you going to gay pride next weekend?
rory:
01/07/2016  23:49  Order placed

My gf has a showbox with "Kappa" on it
I will get my Ncase M1 tracking number soon
I REALLY hope MyHermes doesn't do the final bit of the delivery
My workplace has shit microphones too

COME ON HERMES GIVE ME MY SHIT OMG
srsly this is pissing me off
Why are they so shit compared to DPD
Why don't you just use Spotify?
Use your student email and get it for £5
Or get a Phillippines VPN and get it for like £1
They need to keep the MAFFIA out
We have forwarded this information to support team, they will contact you within 1-2 working days."
Dropped off at the ParcelShop 13:50 - Thu 14 Jul
I want my shit omg
I just did
But I mean my parcels!!!!
I've been waiting over a month for one of them
Is what.cd a good source for music? I'm trying to find a better source
Spotify doesn't have all the songs I'm after
You have to keep 1:1?
But if everyone is >1:1, then surely it would be hard to find people to upload to?
Why?
Can I get FLAC kpop?
For good reason
FLAC is the best format
ë””í™€ë¦­  - ì«„ê¹ƒì«„ê¹ƒ
It's not about quality, it's about compression
D.Holic - Chewy
FLAC is lossless
It's futureproof
FLAC is lossless and open source
FLAC will work even 1000 years from now
AOA - Miniskirt
AOA - Good Luck
AOA - Heart Attack]#
Thanks!
I don't have :(
If they're so exclusive, then how are they so comprehensive?
On Youtube and Spotify, yeah
Yeah but who is seeding all the music now?!?!?
Girl's Day - Female President
Girl's Day - Expect
Who is seeding all the music on what.cd?
Yeah Expectation
EXID - Up & Down
EXID - Ah Yeah
EXID - Hot Pink
What's the log and cue for?
But CDs are an obsolete medium?
MP3 isn't a good format
There are better lossy formats
OGG?
IDK whether it's possible to hear the difference between 320kbps MP3 and FLAC
It's definitely possible to hear the difference up to 320kbps
Can you tell the difference between FLAC and MP3?
Are you still using your HD600 with a Fiio E10K? lmao
Yeah E17
I have an E7
Can you tell the difference between butter and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter?

Or better headphones?
Yes please

Do you like Skrillex?
I learnt recently that the most important part of your audio chain is your ears
One of my ears got fucked up and I couldn't enjoy listening to music any more
I think my hearing has mostly come back now
The second course of antibiotics has been effective
ME TOO
Now I can listen to music again
And hear enemies in Overwatch
Do you think I am well enough to start exercising again?
I feel so much better than the past few weeks, but I don't want my illness to come back
I mean intense exercise
Not a casual walk
Usually it's recommended not to do anything too strenuous when sick
The schedule for TI6 is so good; the games start once I finish work
Are you going to gay pride this weekend?
lmao
I thought you would be
It's your sort of thing
Lots of homosexuality
All my relationships are sam sex
Do you like same sex relationships?
The TI winner will get more $ than the Germany team after winning the FIFA WorldCup
wtf my buddy invited me round for some drinks and his friend kept flaming me for charging my buddy too much for mileage when we both agreed to it and he never paid me anyway
TI6 will be 60FPS on Twitch, about fucking time

"I had a chat with hermes they promissed to deliver to a different address i hope it'll work out now." - 28th July
5 days later and I still don't have my parcel
Now my hearing has come back, I really want my headphones
wow my net wage is <15k
19,190 gross, 14,957 net
Do you have a new phone yet?
"Our courier has attempted delivery of your parcel; however it was refused by an occupant" WHAT THE FUCK
How the fuck can they possibly fuck up so fucking much?
They're costing my ebay seller so much money
£6.57 for initial delivery
£3.30 for new address
Now an extra £3.30 to return the parcel
I'd be so pissed if I was him
hahahahaha this made me think of you http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36946000
I'm going to go to the gym today for the first time in about a month
My hearing has come back and tinnitus has gone
My ear is occasionally popping though
wtf is this shit? "Our courier has attempted delivery of your parcel; however it was refused by an occupant at the delivery address"
Are MyHermes really this fucking shit?
I can't believe how difficult it is to get my stuff. I've literally never had a problem with DPD
DPD always deliver to my office without any problems
wtf?
Do you think this is too small? http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-54971311.html
My gf wants to live with me now
Yeah, I'd rather have a living room too
A kitchen, bedroom and living room
And maybe a second bedroom and a lodger
wtf "no rent to pay" http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-42796152.html
There's no way someone is sitting on 25% of that property and not charging any rent for it
There's got to be a catch
What about this one? http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-60674252.html
This flat is so weird, I buy 75% of it and then live in the remaining 25% for free
But it means I might be able to get a 15% deposit, which would give me a very low rate
Yeah, I'm a bit skeptical too
Investment/low living cost
Good for finances
I can sell it, I just need to give the council 25% of the sale
Which is fine since I never bought the 25%
IDK I think that might be fraudulant
Allen & Harris are selling it
For the vendor
On behalf of
Yeah, I'll look into it. I'm going to view it this weekend. I don't have to make any decision right now

Doom is on sale right now

My friend just told me he's top 500 in OW now
Can you crack Microsoft Office 2010?
wow Hermes took my parcel back to Scan yesterday, and I already have it now
It just arrived
Scan and DPD are amazing, Hermes is shit
Because Scan sent it as a matter of urgency and used the best DPD service
I can't use it ATM anyway because my Ncase M1 is still in Taiwan
And my Silverstone RVZ01 doesn't support it
I'm more bothered about my Philips Fidelio X2 because I need it right now
My Corsair H105 could have waited a couple more weeks
It's fucking weird how effortlessly DPD deliver to me, whereas Hermes makes it seem like a really fucking difficult challenge
Too bad Hermes beats them on price
As long as there's a cheap option, people will use them
Yeah I'm going to do the same now
Maybe Hermes are okay at delivering to parcel drop-off shops?
IDK why they couldn't deliver to any of my addresses
How the fuck did they get "security issue" and "occupant refused delivery"
Did they just not bother to deliver and instead make up random excuses?
Self-employed is fine as long as the pay and conditions are a high standard
Self-employed drivers is the only reason they're alive though. If they employed drivers then they wouldn't have a price advantage over DPD
wtf is a lognet
What do you think of Parcelforce? I'm tracking my parcel all the way from Taiwan with them!
Would you buy/rent a flat if the service charges were £878.88?
Management fees
Yes
0 rent
But I'll need a mortgage
It applies to renting too
http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-42796152.html
Did you not know that flats have service charges?
Maybe you never looked into what you're paying for exactly
Communal cleaning, ground rent, window cleaning, etc
Yeah but I don't think the sofa will be included
The vendor will likely take it with them when they leave, but I'll find out this weekend
I'm viewing it on Saturday afternoon, so I'll let you know
If they leave any furniture it would be great, because I don't have any
Do you think the flat has enough space for a large gaming desk?
I don't like white, can I get asian instead?
haha reminds me of Germany where they blamed CS:GO and banned E-League from broadcasting because a terrorist went on a shooting spree
It's fucking funny how many people think video games cause more violence than football
IDK what world some people live in
If an immigrant does a crime, why shouldn't they be blamed?
Hitler was an immigrant and look how many crimes he did
Yes
You can commit crimes without physically killing people omg

your internet is fast as fuck
I'm only getting like 7MB/s
7MB/s is probably fine until Twitch doubles their bitrate anyway
Is it weird that I'm satisfied with having slow broadband?
Megabit or megabyte?!?!?!?
video stream quality is so poor that it doesn't matter anyway
wtf but you live in a city
I live in the middle of nowhere and get over ten times your speed, and I just have shitty internet
Fibre is overkill for Twitch and Youtube
omg still nobody has bid more than 99p, I'm starting to get worried that it might cost me more to ship this item than I'll actually get for it
Please may you bid a few £ for it?
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/222197590925?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649
wtf why did you bid £5?
You said you'd put it at £1.04
You might not...
It's an old card
I'm gonna look for a few other items to build up some feedback and clear some space in my room
I had to chase Student Loans Company for ages to get my money back
I'm dreading a letter from the government telling me I need to repay my benefits
wtf they don't give your money back unless you ask them for it?
I was inbetween jobs for a month
I was sacked on 24th December last year, then get offered a job a couple of weeks later
They kept paying me benefits even when I was in work
because my payslips were just over a month apart some months, and HMRC saw I had 0 income for some 28 day periods
So I got benefits and a salary
I told them I was in work a few times, but they didn't care
Got fed up of telling them to stop giving me benefitds
So I just bought lots of Hi-Fi headphones and a new gaming PC
Yeah but without interest
IDK strictly speaking I was owed the money by the government because of the UC rules
They say that if my income in 28 day periods is below the threshold, then I get UC
So I think it's possible to be entitled to benefits even with a salary
Royal Mail too
Hard to take my Amazon parcel to Royal Mail because they're only open when I'm at work wtf
My friend got a £55 refund on his GTX 970 bought from Amazon, but Overclockers.co.uk won't give me any money :(
20% refund for nVidiafalse advertising
They advertised the RAM as 4GB when it's only 3.5
Yeah but the GTX 970 is a better GPU
I'm more interested in GPU performance than RAM
CS:GO at 400FPS
Dota 2 at 200FPS
Overwatch at 250FPS
How did you get a 390 for half the price of a GTX 970?
They're similar price it seems
wow
The cheapest I can find atm is like £200
The other guy bid  £4.98
Are you sure it's a 390?
Because they don't sell that cheap
A fucking good deal
I'm really fat, but it's so weird when my colleagues tell me I'm skinny wtf
I think UK society has a body dysmorphia disorder
Retardness disorder
I would
As rory would say, I'm not a "mouthbreather"
rory hates commoners
rory hates people who play videogames on consoles
And he hates people who like football
No?
Do you hate people who don't do drugs?
wtf
Do you hate foreigners?
I can't wait for my Ncase to arrive because I'll be able to get a sweet OC on my CPU
Gonna get so much more FPS
I bet my PC will be super fast too
wtf?
Why wouldn't I know what sanctimonious means?
lmao how bad do you think my vocabulary is?
10 pints is a lot of alcohol
Those aren't commonly spoken words
Yes it is, I use it every day
The weather is so sanctimonious today
Do you think these headphones are decent? https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyerdynamic-Custom-Street-Headphones-Black/dp/B00UK7ZQXO
I want a pair which fold up nicely like my M50X but have good isolation and a removeable cable
So hard to find something just right
Yes you should
I HOPE YOU GET BETTER AND NOT BE SICK ANY MORE
Why is Office 2010 so hard to crack wtf
I need to find a crack before I work from home again
It's easier to use my home PC
Faster, can attack both my monitors, better AMPDAC, etc
I find it less fucking about
I already have Lync, Citrix, Outlook, etc all set up
The only problem is that Office 2010 keeps telling me my trial will end soon
Not really much effort
I'm always in favour of a little bit of initial setup with long-term payoffs
It's a long-term lazy solution
 Headphones?
A 144hz monitor?
An AMPDAC/soundcard?
50 Overwatch lootboxes?
Samsung Galaxy S7?
Ncase M1?
Toyota Aygo?
50 CS:GO keys?
Ask for a Dragon Lore AWP
Or hold onto it for 10 years and sell it for £100,000

I think my shared clipboard works

I'm just going to have this H105 sitting on my desk for 2-3 weeks now...
Can't install it :(
I want more CPU performance omg!
I could probably take the side of my case off and just leave the H105 hanging in the air...
But IDK whether that would be good for the tubing
It's a refurbished model, so I don't want to put it under unnecessary stress
2/8/2016 9:14 TAIPEI INT AMF

Good idea m9

.bang
ffs my Corsair H105 CPU cooler has arrived but I can't install it until my Ncase M1 arrives from Taiwan
Even though my H105 took over a month to get to me
Fuck Hermes
Still waiting for my Philips Fidelio X2 too
wtf?
TI6?
Yeah, better than Rio for sure
Olympics and FIFA are competing for who can be the most corrupt organisation
I think FIFA are probably the worst ATM
But Olympics are a close second
£330 for a 48" 4k TV not bad
You can use it as 4 1080p monitors
4X24" 1080p monitors
I've been thinking of getting a 4k tv to use both as one large display for films, and also as 4X 1080 for productivity
Since they're getting so cheap now
I think some displays have hardware support for it now
Haven't really looked into HW/SW specifics, but I'm sure it can be done
The technology is there
The easiest would be to buy a display which can act as 4 displays probably
Then plug 4 cables into it or something
Can a single DP cable carry 4 displays?
I really need to figure out how the config woul dwork
I saw a monitor that can do it before, so I know it's possible to do it
I think

£8.33 https://www.amazon.co.uk/HUBSAN-X4-H107-Quadcopter-LEDs/dp/B00ZZGF0Z4
Seems like a bargain
Yeah it does....
I think my credit card company or Amazon will protect me though
If not, it's only £8
I might give it to my brother for Christmas if I haven't broken it
There's a second chance offer I think?

You can send a Second Chance Offer for up to 60 days after the listing ends.
Before making a Second Chance Offer, try and work things out with your winning bidder first.
If your original listing was an eBay Charity listing, the donation preferences that you specified will apply to this Second Chance Offer.
All non-winning bidders have already received a Second Chance offer for this item or have chosen not to receive Second Chance offers.
The one I linked?
Yeah £8.33 wtgf
I've been watching the price because it's the best first time quadcoptor for noobs
The most recommended for noobs
 why do you need mini usb?
Your AMPDAC uses mini USB? I thought mini USB was dead?
Your keyboard too wtf
I think my K65 uses micro, but I haven't really checked
Isn't USB-C going to replace all these USB standards anyway?
Will micro DP replace full sized DP?
I like micro DP because it means I can fit more connectors on my graphics card
A single graphics card with 6 micro DP ports = amazing
I can't find the right portable headphones for me. I can't find any over-ears with a standard 3.5mm cable and replaceable earpads :(
Everything either has stupid earpads or stupid proprietary twist-lock cables
Also, I need it to fold up
My Beyer Custom One Pros would be perfect if they could just fold up omg
Can someone please recommend me a pair of headphones with velour earpads, non-proprietary removable cable, low impedance, foldability, and good isolation?

omg it's happening
Your parcel has been sorted at our hub and is on its way to our delivery depot.
Always spread your savings/investments to mitigate risk
fuck
Shitty open source devs
sort your shit out
I just spoke to a man at Royal Mail who says that he puts letters and parcels through a drug-detecting machine and then calls the police so that they arrest you for buying illegal drugs and interrogate you to find out who you bought them from
You are not a machine
You installed UK keyboard layout
That's not what the Royal Mail man told me
He quit the Royal Mail to work at my office
Even if they asked me for my key, I don't know it
I only know the muscle memory required to enter it on a QWERTY keyboard
fuck knows what my encryption key actually is
I can just unchange it
s/unchange/revert/
It's done pre-boot
By looking at my keyboard and seeing hte keys rearranged
Are you looking forward to your new drone?
£8.33 wtf
oh wow it's even cheaper now!

9/8/2016 7:45 Basingstoke Depot Awaiting payment of customs charges
ficl
fuck
Their jobs do seem kinda redundant
IDK what they actually do
You just go in there to meet them, give them your "proof" of 40 hours of job search, get your benefits approve, then fuck off for a week
Na, mine was pretty straight forward. I asked them for help to get a job and nothing came of that
I just got my benefits signed off once a week
Your parcel is being held in our delivery depot awaiting payment of customs charges. The addressee is being sent a letter outlining the charges and how to pay.
ffs no letter yet
I relisted the graphics card and put it on as fixed price
I don't know if there were any seller fees or not from the auction
But I'm not going to send it to you
What? Rory told me not to send it to him
I can send it to him if he really wants....
But I don't think he wants it
I wish I lived with my gf
My gf is Korean
That makes her better than yours
Racially, at least

You don't do drugs with a prostitute either

My gf always wants sex and tries to force herself on me

I quit coke because I don't want diabetes

Actually, I still do sugar-free energy drinks sometimes
But I'm trying to cut down on it
The acid is so bad for your teeth
Why not?
I don't have my phone in my pocket most of the time
I tried a standing desk, but it's not much better than sitting really

Why don't they just use Linux
It's so easy to upgrade
omfg Hermes just called me
They're going to send it with a different courier
I told them I've given up trying to get them to deliver my parcel to me
They asked me if I wanted them to attempt another delivery lmao
I told them definitely not
It was nice to actually speak to someone from hermes though. I think he will fix it for me
Fucking hell Hermes are bad
My ebay seller requested return to sender 2 weeks ago, and today they called me telling me they don't have the sender's address LMFAO
fucking lol
Refund period starts once the item is received, not when it's sent
s/Refund/Return/
File a claim with my credit card company?
IDK I'll figure something out
The item will be sent out for delivery tomorrow
I'll have my item tomorrow
I should have asked for the Hermes man's direct phone number
I got it
He called again
He said the courier says that reception isn't taking parcels
The courier is a fucking liar. The receptionists told me that nothing ever came
I did
The receptionists wouldn't lie to me about that; they take my DPD parcels all the time
She told me that Hermes never came
The courier is just fucking useless. He said that "occupant refused delivery" when I used another address too
The courier is full of shit and needs to get sacked
I'm never using Hermes again

omg it's so hard working with this person "I have been trying to take the screen shot without success so I will try again shortly and send it to you"
Those forums have been obsolete for a long time
no way there's 2 million accounts on that forum

Hardly anyone uses that Dota forum
"almost two million records"
IDK I don't trust that source
Dota isn't a moba
Is there such a thing as mental domestic abuse?
What sort of things would count as that?
Ah yeah I see
I think it would be a lot harder to prove than physical though?
IDK physical abuse can cause permanent damage/disability or even death
Yeah I guess so
Would it count as mental domestic abuse if I was racist to my gf?
IDK racism is treated very seriously nowadays
What if I told her she's a dirty ugly chink?
Do you think there are cases where someone hates Asian people but has an Asian gf anyway?
I don't want to see your gf
My gf is fitter
In the time it's taken Hermes to bring my parcel from the depot to my office, my other parcel arrived all the way from Taiwan

I was working from home too when I felt like aids a couple of weeks ago
I wasn't sneezing, I just had a really fucked up ear
The only reason I worked from home is that I was sick as a dog and felt like it was a good excuse to work naked all week
Why are you taking that drug?
I built my PC inside my Ncase M1 last night
It took me ages, and I still haven't installed the hard drives or CPU cooler
Or done any cable management
wtf
fuck sake Hermes
Why are you so shit
I don't even want the item any more
It's been so long
Philips Fidelio X2
Finally got my fucking headphones
IDK like a month
I think the drivers might be mismatched but I'm not sure
They're fucking comfy though
Weird, the description said that the missmatch was <60hz and between 2khz and 6khz. But I find the missmatch noticeable at voice frequency
I'll try it on my DAC at home just to be sure
Should I send them back?
I don't think any are missmatched except for my Fidelio X2s
Sometimes it sounds like voices are coming into my right ear but not my left
It sounds off-centre
Worst case scenario I'll send these back and pay a few £ for it
I could do with the money to buy a house anyway
Will be disappointing though, because these headphones are FUCKING COMFY and super amazing
I bet I'll get negative feedback if I send these back now. Because Hermes fucked up so many times
My seller will be pissed
I've never worn headphones more comfy than Fidelio X2 before
Holy shit
I've lost 14kg this year
10kg to go
I thought you were gaining weight and hitting the gym?
How much do you weigh?
Not bad, but I wouldn't recommend going much under that
You should start building some muscle to bring you up to 75kg
I'm at 75.6kg, but I still need to lose some fat and build some muscle
I was almost 90kg at my max!!!
I was fat as fuck m9
Depends on how many kgs the stones are, surely?
Those are some heavy stones. You'll need about 14 of them to equal what my weight was at the start of the year
63kg wow that's light
How tall are you?
Ah you're quite short so 63kg is probably fine
You greatly increase the risk of catching diabetes with that sort of diet
I switched to a low sugar diet so that I won't get lots of diabetes
Do you struggle to find girls shorter than you?
I OCed my CPU to 4.5GHz last night
Because more performance is better than less
I might buy my next CPU from siliconlottery.com
I always get bad bins
What sort of cuber criminals?
s/cuber/cyber/
I'm trying to return an item on ebay atm
He's not responding t my request...
Fuck sake my coffee keeps going cold
I just leave it for 10 mins and it's cold as fuck
Happy Gwangbokjeol
wtf
Why do you have an AMD hexacore?
They're pretty sucky for gaming
You need to do stuff that benefits from many cores for an AMD CPU to be worth it
How large is that case?!?!?
It looks 10X as big as mine

Can I overclock a desk fan?
If I increase the voltage to make it spin faster?
Citrix is shit
Do you like my PC case? I have a Corsair H105 inside it
And a GTX 970
Because I will be moving into a small house soon
I like to fit high-end hardware into tiny cases
You can go really small without compromising any performance nowadays
Me too
As few PCs as possible and as many monitors as possible
I'd use VR as my monitors if the resolution was a lot better
If I had a tonne of money I'd put it in R&D for 8K VR
HansProleman:
You're thinking small
Probably
I think we'll have 4k VR within 5 years
Maybe even within 3
Once we reach 4k it might start replacing jmonitors
I'm going to keep my monitors until the latency comes right down though
Need 240hz VR
I'd replace my monitors at home with VR if it was good enough
I love how Beats headphones are called beats even though they don't beat other headphone manufacturers and only get beaten
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dISNgvVpWlo
3k for oral is pretty good
I'd do it for 1k
IDK what my notice period is, one month probably
Hmmmm if I get an interest only mortgage, I can borrow from my parents and pay them back quickly
Which would allow me to reach a higher LTV
Which of us do you think has the best employer benefits?
I know you get your free flagship phone, but I get a 17% pension and a £5 gym with personal trainer
I think I get a shitload of other benefits too which I haven't really looked into
Can I PM you? I need your help with something
\o/
I have Guild Wars 2 too
haha I just skip the sales now
I have about 500 Steam games I've never played
It's gotten out of hand
I've given up trying to get through my backlog
My grandparents gave me £1,000 yesterday omg
So close to buying a house now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dISNgvVpWlo
I like it when my Korean gf cooks for me
Korean
Okay
I use it np
I never used the numberpad anyway
Did you get the standard non-LED K65?
hahahahah my colleague was just boasting how her phone has 64gb
So I told her mine has 232gb
I'm looking into this too
ViperFX won't make a bad DAC good
HTC 10 for sure is amazing
HTC 10 hands down the best DAC
The Exgynos versions of S7, S7E and Note 7 are decent
LG V20 should be good
LG G5 with the B&O DAC would be good
There's a new Chinese phone too, but I can't remember what it's called
ZTE Axon 7
It's the bestest
You don't think HTC 10 is good?
HTC 10 has the best reviews
I won't buy it the HTC 10 because I fucked up my HTC 9 with water
So I'll get a waterproof Samsung or something
Yeah but you don't have a £5 office gym
It's not free if you're paying for it
My gym is definitely subsidised, and I can go during work
It's a short walk from my desk
Does a Korean give it?
I told my gf to stop sending me pics so that my colleagues stop seeing them on my monitor
yes
I got my PC overclocked to 4.5GHz only going up to 74C in stress testing and really quiet too ^^
Not sure yet, been so busy with Dota
And looking at houses
And mortgages and shit
The new UT is out now, go play it
Monetise with hats
I don't have time to play UT this week

I wish I would qualify for a job
Because I will have mortgage soon
So I need the money
I like £££
wtf
Thank you Bulwark
I'll apply for sure
Meet someone in Korea and never leave
That's what I'd do
China then
You might have mortgage without children like me
I'd just get my gf deported
What about Russia?
My friend just got bought a house by her parents
She literally owns a house now
my mortgage will be <£300 a month
I could get an interest only mortgage for like £160 a month
If I lost my job tomorrow I have £13k to live on
And no rent
Won't be able to buy my house though :(
£850 rent what the fuck
How is your rent 3x my mortgage?

I hope I can afford my rent after I retire
Will you?
Why won't you?
My grandparents have been retired for about 30 years now, it's crazy
Yeah I'm a bit worried about that
My grandparents seem to think it's just a hoxx though

That's what the oil companies want you to believe

I'll move to Korea
Trump will get elected and start WW3
Don't have time right now
wtf
I think I'll buy my next CPU from siliconlottery.com
You pay a little extra, but you get a guarantee that your CPU will OC well
Otherwise you could be unlucky and get a chip that won't OC very far
I don't mind, I'll upgrade my CPU within 10 years anyway
Better binned CPUs can OC with less voltage
So they'll last longer
I actually have my 4690K running at 4.5GHz with very cool temps and very quiet and relatively low voltage, so I'm pretty happy now :)
It's my graphics card that goes to 85C and is noisy ass fuck
Might upgrade to a GTX 1080TI or something
I love how the symbols for TOXIC and VERY TOXIC are identical
haha yeah
The main character is a terrible actress
And her sugar daddy too
And her boyfriend
All terrible actors
There's nothing special about her IMO
And her boyfriend is the most boring character ever

HTC 10 is a very nice phone
Stop looking at phones just by the brands
A good phone is a good phone regardless of brand
If you're on a budget, I recommend Oneplus 3 or ZTE Axon 7
ZTE Axon 7 looks like an amazing budget phone
Srsly good value
Holy fuck
That milk and fruit
Dropping what?
I am dropping half a pound a day
In weight
I need to get into shape
No, I'm just overweight
It's not really unhealthy unless you're losing more than ~4lbs a week
~170 I think
Not sure, I think the scales are shit
The scales say I'm at 163 with some clothes on
You're overweight
You should try to lose ~20lbsa
Would be good for your health
How often do you lift?
2X/week isn't much
I lift 4 times a week and do cardio on top of that
You should try to do something every day
My PC is almost built
Got to install some dust filters and hard drives and do some cable management
Got to figure out how to make my graphics card stop being noisy as fuck
My CPU cooler is so quiet now, but my graphics card is fucking loud
Even at idle, it spins up to 20%
It's the noisiest part in my case for sure
When I'm gaming, it goes so loud
My brother has gained so much weight since he got married
I tried adjusting the fan curve so it's less than 20% under 60C, but it just goes up to 60C anyway....
The fan is just noisy...
I'll just replace the card probably
I don't mind it spinning up when I'm gaming because I'll have my headphones on loud anyway, but it's stupid how it's loud even at idle
Probably won't bother with a 3rd party cooler for a last-gen card
I'll just save up for a 1080TI or something after I buy my house
I'll read reviews to find something that's quiet at idle
I need a new card anyway because my GTX970 is bottlenecking my 4.5GHz 4690K
£800 wtf
My CPU kept crashing so I've had to increase the voltage up to 1.260v now :(
If it keeps crashing, I might have to go even higher
Damn, I forgot to leave my PC stress-testing today
I can't stress-test my PC overnight because it makes my room too hot
wtf Hermes tracking says my item has been delivered to the seller, but ebay is saying the item is still in transit
I have entered the correct tracking number to ebay
"No tracking information to show. Please check back later."
I can't get to the "refund sent" stage until ebay updates ffs
What should I do?
I got a final value fee of 50p for that graphics card
With my direct debit set up for Paypal, will it take it out of my bank account directly?
Yes please
Can you give me some weed too?
If you pay using Paypal but don't have a Paypal balance, does it come out of your bank account by direct debit instead?
I can link my paypal to my credit card?
I like paying by credit card because then I don't have to pay any money for a while

I have a Chinese friend in Durham
lmao last night I enabled 'fast boot' which disables my USB keyboard until the OS has booted. I can't decrypt my hard drive or get into my BIOS now
My IT department gave me a USB to PS2 adapter which might do the trick, otherwise I will need to reset the CMOS
I think there's a CMOS reset on the board
But I have a fucking huge CPU cooler to take off first
haha no I don't
IDK why I enabled it
Where did you live before?
My CPU cooler is way bigger than my motherboard
My motherboard is m-itx which is tiny and my CPU cooler is H105 which is fucking huge

Is it unreasonable for me to ask my gf to pay half the council tax, water, electricity, broadband, and gas bills?
wtf she's the one who needs sex all the time
Most of the time I only do it because she makes me
Because she insists
Split rent too?
Iota reported for ability abuse

So I probably won't upgrade any components this year
I might get a Philips Fidelio X2 and a new mouse though
Then see what Kabylake and Zen are like

About half a kilo of sugar a day
One of these a day https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tate-Lyle-Fairtrade-Granulated-Sugar/dp/B005RYCJMG

I've been exactly £750 in debt for about a year now
CBA to ever pay it off
I'm 24

I'll be in debt by over £100k soon
Actually, I think probably only around £90k
I'll have the last laugh with my 20% pension whilst you're paying 20% on credit card debt
I earn 20%, you pay 20%
What's the context?
What's the negative about?
Oh I see
And the positive is your cash?
wow how do you have such a small amount of cash?
Do you only save like £100 a month or something?
Yeah rory will have more cash than me soon
I also have a gf and rory does not, so it's not as black and white as you make it out to be
gfs are expensive
How much do you spend on your gf a month?
Yes
Oh nice, I have a K65 too! I took it into my office and everyone got angry with me
wow you pay off £250 a month of debt
I get >4% on >10k
Credit card debt?
Yeah it's a really nice keyboard
My lowest account is 4%, my highest is 6%
Can't you just do a 0% balance transfer so you're not paying interest any more?
Student overdrafts are great, but won't yours expire soon because you graduated almost three years ago?
Your credit score is not good?
My credit score is only 719 :(
Yes
Who is your £900 0% with?
I think so
wtf how you get that with TSB?
I didn't think they gave 0% overdrafts that high
Thought it was only like £10
Yeah I know, but Experian is the big one
That overdraft is with your TSB 5% current account?
Why?
Are you sure it's not a graduate account overdraft?
How long ago did you graduate?
Classic Plus
Same here
Are you sure it's 0%?
No fees?
Or is there a daily usage fee?
Free for only three months?
When did you open it?
http://www.tsb.co.uk/current-accounts/classic-plus-account/
Classic and Classic Plus - £25 (+£10 buffer)
Mine is only £35 wtf
https://thepb.in/p/pghQ0YvDLMqtR
But there's fees and interest?
Are you actually using your overdraft?
You got your overdraft when you created your account?
A year ago?
Oh cool
I can't apply for more right now because I am trying to get a mortgage :(
...
Are you sure?
Okay...
Just explain to them you made a mistake, and they'll refund the fees
They won't refund the interest, but you'll get your £6 back
You should apply for a Nationwide and First Direct overdraft. I have £250 forever with First Direct and 12 months £500 with Nationwide. You can also get £2,000 for up to 3 years with Santander Graduate Account
I'm literally never going to pay First Direct back
Except for once every month
Nationwide has a £500 a month 5% regular saver
5% £2,500 current account
And 0% 12 month overdraft with no £ limit
If your credit score is good, maybe you'll get a 0% £5k overdraftr
No need to switch, TSB is good too
Just open a Tesco account or something and switch that for the bonus £££
Or if I give you a referral link for Nationwide, we get £100 each
Isn't TSB only 5% up to 2k?
You said your current is 5% up to 2.5k
Let me know if you need a referral link for a free £100 if you want to switch to Nationwide
hahahahaha Samsung just sent me an email asking to meet me
I hope so
IDK something about supporting our colleagues who have Samsung devices or something

IDK desktop PCs are just so far ahead in terms of price:performance right now that I don't see it changing any time soon
Laptops are expensive, expensive to upgrade, noisy, underpowered
My Ncase M1 is only 12.6 litres
And it can fit high-end full-power parts
I have a desktop and a smartphone
Most gamers have desktops
wtf
Most video editors and CAD and photoshoppers are desktops too
I mean core gamers
Not filthy casuals
...
Well you can be a core gamer on a laptop
But you get a sucky and expensive experience
So most people don't do it
lmao no laptop is as powerful as a high-end PC
Unless it's really really big
But then it's no more portable than a PC
https://hardforum.com/threads/hutzy-xs-ultra-compact-gaming-case.1894641/
You can probably fit more performance in that case than any laptop
No laptop is as powerful as my 12.6 litre Ncase M1 PC
Or as quiet
The worst thing about a laptop is that there's very little you can repair/upgrade
You need to replace the whole laptop to upgrade/repair the monitor, GPU, CPU, motherboard, PSU, etc
I think my next upgrade will be to buy a well-binned 7700K
Need more CPU power
My 4.5GHz 4690K is bottlenecking my GTX 970 :(
Need an i7
I shouldn't have cheaped out on an i5

Isn't WoW just a big Skinner's Rat experiment?
Do you ever talk about stuff that isn't drugs?
wtf
wtf is /r/uktrees
Is it NSFW?
If it was Linux it wouldn't get into the official distribution repositories, right?
I think today I will do some cardio or legs
Done enough shoulders and chest

Interest is paid annually
Gonna get some fat interest payments soon ^^

I have three regular savers
I put £300 into my First Direct account every month at 6%, £250 into TSB at 5%, and £500 into Nationwide at 5%
Also, £200 into Halifax at 4% + 25% bonus
I kinda wish I got a Nationwide Help To Buy for dat £1000 bonus though
Yes
I'll just borrow the cashback from my stepdad and then repay him once I get it
Yeah it is a scandal
But it hurts poor people more
Doesn't really affect me because my parents are rich and willing to loan me short-term
I don't actually save £1,250 a month, I just drip-feed
So my current account balance decreases over 12 months
Then goes back up
I probably only save around £1,100 a month
That's not including the £271.86 I put into my pension
How much do you put into your pension a month?
What's share scheme?
HOLY SHIT
You pay more tax than my take home pay
Share scheme = investment fund?
So basically pension?
????????
why is your pension only £150? Shouldn't you put more into that because of the tax benefits?
I'm worried about putting too much into my pension because IDK if I'll live long enough to retire
I'll probably die of heart disease or car crash before I'm 50
wtf
Can children have religious affiliation and sexual orientation?
And credit scores?
lmao yeah
Young children definitely aren't old enough to make informed decisions on religious and political affiliation
I went to a religious school when I was younger, but I wasn't old enough to have an informed opinion on the probability of existence of a divine being
s/have/make/
IDK what mine was, CoE probably
Always made me feel uncomfortable during receptions every morning when they'd make us sing religious songs
It felt so forced
Yeah we had that shit too
Well not school church I think
But still, it seemed so weird
Did you think it was weird at the time?
Did you ever feel like you CBA to sing the hyms any more?
You rebel!
Even though I went to an indoctrinated school, I don't think any of my classmates are religious
So IDK what the point of it all was
My parents aren't religious either
Religious schools seem like a relic from the olden days
When people went to church because they didn't have video games or anything fun to do
Would you date a grill if she had a child?
wtf?
You want to die alone?
You only pay lots of tax because your salary is so high
Get a shitty low salary like mine then see how much tax you pay

Hey we're friends on Spotify now
wtf are you talking about

Someone told me in #techsupport last night why my FPS sucks
Amdahl's law
Is it just me, or are DT770 earpads relaly fucking good?
They're thin but not uncomfortable, they're comfortable but isolate well, they're soft but don't pick up all the hairs and dirt
I quite like my AKG K702 earpads too, but DT770 pads are amazing for isolation considering their comfort
I just want to find a pair of headphones with DT770-like pads but also fold up for portable use!
My Beyer Custom One Pros would be perfect if only they folded up
Mine work fine
They're just not as comfy or have as good sound quality as my Beyers
Or isolation
M50X are definitely overhyped
M50X's sound quality is vastly outperformed by most other mid-fi headphones in the studio and at home
Most open headphones, DT770s, etc are just so much better sounding
And their isolation is beaten by DT770s and pretty much all IEMs and even most closed-back headphones
You sound like someone who has only ever owned one pair of headphones and thinks M50x are le best
IDK never tried Beats
Beats have such a bad reputation that I've never bought them
wtf kpop is amazing m9
Family Guy did an episode about kpop recently
No of course not lmao
If it's men/unattractive women and in english then it's just One Direction lmao
Or Justin Beiber
Stop trolling
Are your M50X the only decent headphones you've tried? I think you'd be blown away by how good Philips Fidelio X2 sounds
Or my AKG K702
Or rory's HD600
They shit on your M50X
M50X have no soundstage
And muddy bass
You should go to a headphones shop and try on some of these cans
TRIGGERED
They're earbuds I think?
She probably hasn't ever tried velour circumaurals, there's nothing comfier than that
Have her try on a pair of DT770s or AKG K702s
Or Philips Fidelio X2
Amazing comfort and amazing sound quality too

I need an i7
Yes, I would like a well-binned 7700K
siliconlottery.com
Might buy my next CPU from there
Nope, that's why I haven't bought a 6700K yet
But one day I will own an i7 CPU
It's not urgent right now
IDK it won't be too bad unless Intel start making better CPUs
Intel hasn't made a decent CPU since Sandy Bridge
lmao no
AMD CPUs suck
Hmmmm not sure, maybe because some people need integrated graphics
Maybe the price:performance ratio is competitive with Intel at the low-mid range
4690K
They're pretty bad for high refreshrate gaming
You have lower IPC though
Much lower
the average number of instructions executed for each clock cycle. It is the multiplicative inverse of cycles per instruction.
It's an i5, which means it doesn't have HT
It means that one of my CPU cores running at 4GHz is faster than one of your CPU cores running at 4GHz
This is a game that's heavily multithreaded, and the AMD CPUs still can't keep up http://www.techspot.com/review/1180-overwatch-benchmarks/page5.html
They're running all the CPUs with a GTX 1080

You gonna watch lots of Youtube videos and play some videogames?
Nobody will know if you play videogames at home
You could do anything and nobody would know
If I don't make babies, will I be richer and retire at an earlier age?
That's more likely to happen if you create lots of babies
I think my parents resent how much I've costed them. Even though I'm >18 and they don't take me on holidays and stuff any more, I'm always asking them for money
£229,251 no way
That's insane
I would quite like to have that money
I could build a really sick gaming PC
And a house
I have like 20 days
Yeah no reason not to
Gonna hold onto 5 until April
I like to hoard it for emegencies
April, but I can keep 5 until the end of May
I might take a random week out in November or February or something
Or maybe I'll take a random week out late September or October
October is weird, usually they reset in April
I'm taking 28th of October and 31st of October off to make it a 4 day weekend to go to my sister's wedding and see my gf
And 22nd of February off to go to a dentist appointment lmao
After that, I still have 17 days to take
I sometimes take a monday off if I'm visiting my gf on a weekend
Yes
It's not April Fools day though?
I'm thinking of buying these, but IDK if I'll like them... http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Etymotic-ER4S-Earphones-for-professional-studio-users-brand-new-RRP-249-/302055871821?hash=item4653eed54d:g:23sAAOSwM4xXZusN
I've never seen them priced so low before
They're supposed to have better isolation than any other IEM on the market other than some customs, but they're deep insertion
IDK if I'll like the comfort
It's neutral and doesn't have a lot of bass, but I don't think my SE215s which are bass-heavy IEMs sound very good anyway. I'm not sure if I'm really actually a basshead
I think my K702s sound better than DT770s, and DT770s are bassy and K702s are bright
So maybe I don't actually like bassy headphones
I thought I did, but maybe not
But I know I do like bass sometimes....
Bass is fun
I just like clarity more
I hate it when bass distorts the audio and you lose clarity though
Detail is important to me because I hate distorted audio
If I open the box and try them on, can I still return them to the ebay seller?
omg me too
NSFW OMG
wtf no you said it was a nug
Don't give me nightmares pls
What laws do you actually care about?
I care about amdahl's law
It has big implications on my everyday life
It means I only get 400FPS instead of 420
Well it retards technical advancement
Instead of building a 50GHz CPU, we could just make 12 core 4GHz CPUs
And get the power of a 50GHz CPU
It caused Intel to become a monopoly as AMD bet on more cores instead of higher IPC
And because of that, Intel hasn't made a good CPU since 2011
If I bring my mechanical keyboard to work and just go on IRC all day, I'll seem like the hardest worker in the office despite being the least
I know so little about that topic that I don't really have an opinion
IDK even what a burqa is exactly
Terrorists should definitely be banned from public places though
£300 is a fuckload of money to spend in a month
You could get three pairs of good headphones every month
You could go on holiday to Turkey twice a month
You could buy 300 cans of Relentless
You could buy 40kg of protein powder every month
You could buy a new smartphone every month
finding a lawyer who get me unbanned lmao
Amazing how delusional fat people can be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrWMitkz7J4
They think being fat is healthy and that society is the problem and not them lmao
And they think they're being discriminated against because the doctor told them to lose weight and people don't find them attractive
One of them even compared fat discrimination to black discrimination in pre-1970s America lmao
obesity is a spectrum
Some people are a few kilos overweight, some people are fucking fat as fuck
You shouldn't just cram the food in until you can't eat any more lmao
Just eat until you've had enough
Maybe you eat slower and don't force overconsumption
I could eat way larger portions if I really wanted to
But I don't, because I have self control
I just can't find IEMs which have the comfort, isolation and sound quality I'm after. I think I'll just save up for some CIEMs
I was thinking about getting some ER4Ps, but I think I'll get fed up with the comfort eventually and just end up saving for CIEMs anyway
I'll just stick with my SE215 until I can afford some Custom Art Music Ones
omg new Sennheiser headphones
Sennheiser just announced a new range
https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/50t7sn/new_sennheiser_headphones_hd559_hd569_hd579_and/
Sennheiser products aren't really for me
I prefer AKG, Fidelio, and Beyer
How much did the cable cost?
HD600 connects to the cable on both earcups?
You mean it makes them warmer?
Your HD600 are neutral, right?
You should try bright headphones like my K702
Beats peasants hate them
Proprietary connectors suck, that's why I don't buy Senns
QC headphones are for trains and planes
They suck everywhere else
They're designed to cancel out constant noise
I decided against getting the Etymotics this weekend, and I'm going to save up for CIEMs instead!
Yeah
They're supposed to be a lot comfier than universal IEMs
I have to go see an audiologist to get moulds made for my ears though
I'll stick with my muddy Shure SE215s until I am ready for CIEMs
They get uncomfy after a while because the foam is trying to expand inside my ear
So it makes my ear get a bit achey from resisting it
Imagine if you had something pushing against you constantly
I'll probably buy a house first, then save up for CIEMs
Probably these http://www.thecustomart.com/music_art-custom.php
You can't get customs for much cheaper than that
I've read that the 80Ohms sounds a lot nicer than the 32ohms. I've only used the 80ohms so I can't compare
I like the Beyer Custom One Pros. I sold my DT770s and found a pair of COPs for £76
What mouse are you getting?
If I was to buy a mouse today, I'd probably get DM Pro 1 S
Mouse
wow you sure do like shit hardware
How heavy are those mice?
120 grams?
wtf are ounces
yeah what rory said
A kg is a bag of sugar
I bet it isn't
Or a bag of sugar
Depends on how heavy the water is m9
Warm water is lighter than cold water
85g is pretty good
What's the dimensions?
What?
So I was right and you were left?
niceeeeeee
I love it when someone admits they're wrong
If it was my mum, she'd never admit her mistake
She thinks admitting error is a sign of weakness or something
Mice can weigh anywhere between 80g and 200g
Lower is better because you have less inertia so it's easier to stop and change directions

Are you still using your Fiio?
Sound Blaster E5/X7 is good if you're gonna use any of the features
You can connect your phone via bluetooth and answer calls on it
And NFC
Plug in a mic too
And some speakers
Sound Blaster E5 has a battery built-in
Has mics built-in
And bluetooth and NFC
And has two headphone outputs
And goes up to 600ohms!!!!
My Sound Blaster E5 was a big upgrade over my E10K.
My DT770s used to have some bass rattle with E10K and my E5 fixed it
It also has an EQ and some other DSP features
It's got soooooooooo many features man
Do Schitt make any good portable ones?
get the E5 then!!!!
It's sooooooooooo good
That is totally stupid
just buy Beats if you care about fashion so much
Why don't you just get the Sound Blaster E5 and spray paint it silveR?
The only problem with the Sound Blaster E5 are the lack of Linux drivers

Just lots of lines of whining
I don't think she liked that question

I really need to get a thermal container; my coffee always goes cold every morning and I have to keep remaking it :(
Oh nice, a kettle on your desk? I have to walk all the way to the kitchen!
Gives me an opportunity to stretch my legs during 8 hours of sitting at my desk every day though
I see you have a tube amp now?
Aren't open backed headphones unsuitable for the office? You're subjecting everyone around you to your awful music
Tube amps aren't the best IMO
They colour the sound a little and don't have any real benefits
You should just ask your company to issue everyone with DT770s
haha I saw a thread on /r/headphones about manky DT770 pads
You could just clean them
how much did new pads cost you?
Why?
Quite a lot for earpads
https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/51bks7/ps_replace_velour_pads_on_your_beyer_dynamics/
I fucking love DT770 earpads
The isolation is so good for comfy velour pads
Replacing my COP earpads with my DT770 earpads made them so much comfier
You should try some Beyer COPs if you ever get the chance
You can customise the sound signature, the faceplates, and the cable, to make your ultimate custom experience!
You can customise the headband like with the DT770 too
I really like them
I could never use HD600s in my office
I'd need to book a room to go and wear them
My part of the office is quite noisy because I'm between the housing team and the IT team, so all the sound would leak in and ruin my music
I need decent isolation
Because my office gets fucking noisy
Although today I'm in a different office and there's literally just the two of us on the whole floor
I only get 1GB with openmailbox :(

wow I just realised that I would have got a student loan ~£3,500 a year greater if my parents didn't have an income
And that my extreme poverty at uni was caused by my parents being rich
Student loans aren't a debt, they're a tax
And even with the minimum amount lent to me, I'm probably still not going to pay it all off
Most people won't unless they go straight into a £50k job after graduating like rory
wtf the median income is not in the 40% tax band

I'm keeping an eye on Sennheiser's new portable cans
I've yet to find a decent pair of over-ear portable cans
The problem is always a proprietary cable, bad earpads, inability to fold, bad noise isolation, or some other little problem
I'm trying to find a no-compromise solution
Because ATM I have to sacrifice one feature
Maybe I should just get CIEMs and not bother with trying to find portable over-ears
7.8 words per line, god your so lazy with your typing!

Have you ever bled out of your ear?
Yes
One time I woke up and my pillow was covered in blood because my ear was bleeding
Yes
Yes
My hearing came back, my tinnitus went, the pain went, and my ear stopped bleeding

Ruined the sound quality of my headphones
I found out that the biggest bottleneck in the audio chain is not the DAC, AMP or even the headphones, but your own ears

I can put them on my lap and then lean backwards, but I CBA

Just bought
And a t-shirt
Hey rory
I ordered lots of stuff from myprotein.com
5kg of Strawberry Cream Whey protein
a t-shirt
10X50g of Beef Jerkey of assorted flavours
wtf why is the coffee made for me so bad compared to the coffee I make myself
Do cleaners bring their own vacuum cleaners?
Maybe get a gf so that she looks after your flat for you
Oh shit I forgot to bring my headphones into work today
I can't believe that it's the CURRENT YEAR and I can still see people outside having a smoke break
Smoking is not cool
I like pineapple
Really sweet and tasty
Are you going to get Amazon Dash?
I don't need one because mine majically replaces itself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-3c8iWxhe0
I have one of those
wtf are you talking about?
and you're stalking her on flightradar?
Are you going to sex her?
Why is she coming then?
Do you think sex is implied as a condition of her free bed and breakfast?
When my gf gives me free bed and breakfast in Brighton I always have to sex with her
She makes me even if I really don't want it
It's hard to stop her when I'm tired as fuck and she won't let me sleep until she's satisfied
Just have to let her get on with it
Do you like China and Korea?
Do you think EU, SEA and NA are nicer regions than Africa and the Middle East?
I have friends in China and Korea who would let me stay with them for free
Yeah they are shit regions
Is anyone else using nVidia fast sync?
Do you have a Spree card?
I spend way too much time during my daily commute trying to turn right at a roundabout that's completely blocked by traffic going straight across
It's annoying as fuck because they're blocking a lane of traffic just because they're afraid of anyone turning left
I don't
Because I'm not an ass
If they don't block up the other entrance, then people will pull out in front of them
lmfao why?
He can earn more money if he does more jobs
Can't you get an all you can travel tube ticket for like £6?
Why?
One time I went on the tube and this black man gave a speech to the carriage about how he was poor and struggling or something. I looked at him the whole time and he walked past me and told me to stop looking at him
London people are weird
I was a bit worried he was going to knife me or something, it is London after all!
What is to do?
There's a lot of hot grils in London though
Why?
Why are you cracking?
What's it for?
What do you need the password for?
wtf just got banned from #techsupport for saying that not all bittorrent is piracy
? You can download ubuntu isos with bittorrent
When I get my own place, should I use Sky TV, Freesat, Stremio or Kodi as the OS for my TV?
I'm leaning towards Stremio because I'm familiar with it
And they announced Stremio Circle recently which is like Chromecast but for Stremio I think
Yeah Sky seems like a ripoff. My dad is paying something ridiculous like £100 a month
What do you think of Stremio?
It's like Popcorn Time but with plugins
You can stream TV, films, watch Twitch, Youtube, etc
You can subscribe to Youtube channels and TV series and it'll alert you when a new episode is out
And you can view your calendar
XBMC = Kodi?
Has your drone arrived yet?
Torrent them?
If there isn't a torrent, go to the library, borrow the book, and make a torrent
Do you think the lecturer is just doing it to increase the sales of his book?
That's a horrible business practice
Since when is education supposed to be about milking the students for everything they have?
You should pirate his books then tell him you pirated them because he is trying to extract maximum profits from his students
game design from 2003?
Considering the age of the medium and progress of technology, surely 2003 is outdated?
SURELY
What uni is it?
Did you choose a bad module or something?
2003 game design textbook lmao
What a fucking joke
That's pre-HL2
I love looking in the mirror after a workout; I always look ripped ass fuck
hahahahaa
I'd google gogo girl but I'm afraid that what I might find is NSFW
Is it like a dancer?
The gril who plays Jubilee in the new Xmen is Vietnamese
She's the hottest gril in xmen
Have you ever tried Stremio?
lmao just got an email telling me that IT are migrating to a new email system and I need to click a link and give them my information by 20th September
It's a bit creepy and perverted, isn't it?
I emailed Scott in IT and he said it's a scam
You gotta question stuff that looks like it's probably a scam
Yeah but that requires getting out of my desk and walking 10 feet down the office
Actually, maybe only about 8 feet
I prefer to email people sitting next to me so I don't have to take my headphones off
Oh it's an external internal test
A few people filled it out lmao
Did you hear that League Of Legends has over 100m players now lmao
This LoL employee called Pendragon is a real greedy evil shady cunt https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/52jvcz/background_the_history_of_pendragon_by_tzjinzo/
And the most casual
I think LoL is just expanding into developing countries
They don't have interest in esports, they just play the game casually like candy crush
I calculated that roughly 45% of Dota players regularly watch pro games but only about 14% of LoL players
Or rather, that's the player:viewer ratio
LoL esports is just an advertisement for the game instead of trying to be something good itself
That's why the prizepool has been the same for about 4 years
They don't want to invest more into it
smelly LoL nerds haha
Can you take your wheelchair friend to Alton Towers?
It's good to take disabled people to theme parks
because you can skip all the queues
Maybe drug him
Put a gag on him
You know what else is gay? Waiting in queues at theme parks!
I'm worried I'll get a tax bill next month
Because they gave me universal credit whilst I was working for some reason
And I might be asked to repay it...
I hope not
I have a fucking massive bag of protein powder on my desk right now
It's 5kg
Gonna last me over a year probably
Did you pick the lock?
ffs I have 16 days of leave left and I don't know what to do with them
Motor sports are pretty boring
That reminds me, the drone I bought on Amazon still hasn't arrived
I should have it by now
Expected by 12 Sep
Has your drone arrived yet?
Actually ffs they aren't even drones, they're quadcoptors
You dodged a bullet there m9
They took my money and I never got anything
Yeah they'll refund all 7 of my £s lmao
wtf is that weird creature
Do you think I can move my grandparents' sofa by myself?
I wouldn't need to pivot if there weren't any walls or ceilings
Or other obstacles
The problem is that a sofa is larger than myself
And isn't flexible
So it's fucking awkward to get it through doorways
I could probably lift it onto my back and walk away with it easily if it's under 60kg
If it wasn't so fucking big
I think the council is going to take it away
But I need to move it to the front of the house
My grandmother is disabled
I am probably the strongest in my family
But being strong doesn't really make it any easier to move a sofa
It's all about pivoting really
Unless you don't have walls
She's hundreds of miles away
And she's not strong
The council are taking it to the dump
I can just drag it through the doorways
I think I can do it myself since it doesn't matter if it gets damaged at all
Does the quality of the bed even matter if you've got a good mattress?
I doubt it, he's really fat
Philips Fidelio X2 20% off on Amazon
Just snagged one for £135.54
Yeah...
£135 for a pair of headphones better than rory's £220 headphones
I don't have enough information to give you any good advice on your decision
I don't think I will be able to advise you on this one
What?
I'd just rather give you no advice than bad advice
I hope my Fidelio X2 comes in the same condition as my Beyers did
"minor cosmetic perfection" but they were in perfect condition
Yes sorry
My Beyers were supposed to be imperfect, but they came in really great condition
So I have high hopes for my Fidelio X2
These are gonna be my endgame headphones, except maybe for some CIEMs
For home listening, I'll probably be satisfied
But I need to improve my portable setup
Because I'm not happy with my M50X or SE215
I'm thinking maybe some CIEMs will solve it
rory also wants to know my thoughts on the Fidelio X2 once I have them
My drone never arrived, so Amazon are going to refund me
I wonder if it'll actually arrive, I can keep it and the money?
My Fidelio X2s are arriving today, you jealous?
omg I booked a meeting room so I can go make some phone calls in quiet, and then I find some assholes are already in there
wtf
I have to use Lync, but I'm sat between IT and housing which are always so noisy
So it's easier to book a room and then use the shitty Lync headset in a quiet room
There's literally zero isolation with my Lync headset, it's pathetic how shit our headsets are
I use V-Moda Boompro
Blue Yeti blocks the view of my monitors
And Blue Yeti picks up the sound of my mechanical keyboard more too
V-Moda Boompro is better for gaming IMO
Yeah I considered getting a swing arm Blue Yeti for gaming, but it's just so overkill
It's not worth it unless your a streamer
The V-Moda Boompro does the job
No?
Are you a streamer?
wtf
your creepy m9
I like grils
Asians
I'm not into skinny white dudes lmfao
Anyone has a bigger chest than my gf lmao that doesn't mean shit
My gf is Korean
Like my new headphones? https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-X2-00-Fidelio-Headphone-Black/dp/B00MRUPSHQ
wtf
rory cares
Don't you, rory?
ffs the headband seems a bit kinked
Gonna return these
Gonna order brand new ones
There are way too many defective versions of the Fidelio X2 to get a decent used one for cheap :(
fuck sake Amazon
I ordered it brand new for £157
"Arriving 7 Oct - 17 Oct" :(
At least I should get one that's actually good
Gonna return this one
    I hope my Fidelio X2 comes in the same condition as my Beyers did
    "minor cosmetic perfection" but they were in perfect condition
Yes sorry
My Beyers were supposed to be imperfect, but they came in really great condition
So I have high hopes for my Fidelio X2
Na, these are worse than I thought they'd be
These aren't just "minor cosmetic imperfection"
The fucking headband is kinked and it has the Gibson fucked up glue problem too
Fucking hell Apple support is weird
You are very welcome and great job in catching that email! I am glad that we were able to work together to get you on a clear path to a resolution. I want to be sure you are 100% satisfied with me before ending the chat. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
Yeah Samuel, Iâ€™m sorry that you even received such an email, that email is not affiliated with Apple nor iTunes at all and has nothing to do with your actual iTunes account, it is designed for you to follow a link and provide compromising details.
I've been getting way too many of these phishing emails recently
Wanted to be sure it wasn't fraud
Don't want to lose money if I can do a simple check to be certain
If I wasn't 100% certain then I could lose money and damage my credit rating
Apple can easily check whether or not I purchased anything
Your gf is white
That's not really a safe assumption; most of my internet accounts aren't my real name.
Yeah but if Apple called me "Mcfucknugget" would you then assume it was my real name?
Jokes on you, I'll be moving soon
Feel free to order me Dominoes in the mean time though
It takes time to save up lots of money
You srs?
Will we get really high and work out lots?
Would we go 'on the pull'?
Yeah I need to be careful of those sort of numbers now too
I thought I had 200 minutes
But it seems a lot of numbers cost extra wtf
IDK why
We should go to Leeds uni and meet lots of cute Chinese grils
Are they Chinese?
wtf
I ordered a brand new Fidelio X2, but I have to wait up to a month for it :(
In the mean time, I will return this one
Can't get a good quality used one
The second hand market of X2s is flooded with lemons
Amazon marketplace can be a bit luck of the draw
Sometimes you get something really good, sometimes now
Or is it Amazon Warehouse?
Yes, it's Warehouse I think
You should order one, they're at the lowest price they've ever been right now!
£157 so low!
Never been lower!
Did you hear about Hugh Mungus? Some gril claimed she was sexually assaulted because she asked a man what his name is and he said "Hugh Mungus" lmao
I saw another video where some gril told a man "privileged white men don't get assaulted like women do" then he said "men can be victims of assault too" then she assaulted him
Was pretty funny
Check it out https://youtu.be/nI88pIBjDdQ
Then she asked him to apologise lmao
omg look at this fucking misogonist https://youtu.be/qW3m03eL7Es
What a fucking sexual assaulter
?
wtf
I have a Korean gf
I'd rather just get a 27 month 0% purchase card and buy a phone and pay minimum payments
And get the SIM seperately
Would be lower monthly payments, lower initial cost, and lower overall cost
I see no reason to ever get a phone on contract
You don't have to save up for a credit card
You don't even need to save for the initial deposit
Are you watching it not?
My friend got angry with me for doing what your doing
He told me I'm one of those assholes who talk during a film
I was typing and watching during work too!!!!

Just bought a new gaming mouse yay
Logitech Prodigy G403
Just came out, and it's really really nice
It's a pro mouse
Buttons just add weight
I finally bought a new gaming mouse
After using the same mouse for years
I finally found a worthy successor to my Logitech G400s
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/322265985830?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT
I got it for £10 cheaper than Amazon ^^
haha one of the directors is right in front of me as I shitpost on IRC
I guess I could
But why?
I don't spend too much time on that since it has negligible impact on performance and I don't buy windowed cases anyway
It's harder to ship a built PC than it is to ship the components.
Because the CPU cooler and GPU are large heavy parts hanging off your motherboard
AIOs probably ship okay
I wouldn't recommend it unless you get insurance on the shipping or something
That's one of the reasons I like AIOs that most people don't consider; I'd rather have a 1kg radiator mounted to my case during shipping rather than to the motherboard itself
Yeah sure
Can advise you on parts too if you want
There might be a 1080TI by then
Second hand GPUs are often great value
Ncase M1?
It's pretty niche and expensive
I wouldn't recommend it to most people
You can get pretty good cases for less than 1/3rd of the price
I just bought it because I'm obsessed with cramming as much performance as possible into as small a case as possible
Are you going to get a Kaby Lake and GTX 1080?
That would be my dream build
7700K and GTX 1080TI
With a 240hz gsync monitor
Why do you want a gaming PC when you don't even play video games anyway?
4GB is pretty low nowadays
Most new builds have 16GB because RAM is so cheap now
ffs I wish my parents didn't buy me a proprietary Sony camera because now I can't extract the photos from the proprietary flash storage card
I hope I don't win this photo competition now
Will be embarrassing if I can't provide a high resolution version
They're going to announce the winner soon
Fuck
I'm in trouble
EU West
I'm going to be so screwed if they announce me as the winner today
I don't think I can provide a high resolution copy
Why?
Did you work at a photography firm?
I hope I don't win
I don't want to be embarrassed to the whole company
I own a car
I drive it every day
I sometimes drive to where Iota lives
lmao enjoy walking to Iota's house
Brighton is full of homeless people
They harass me on the street
I do like all the Asians there though
wtf are you talking about, they're clearly homeless bums
I know what a fucking homeless person looks like
Yeah I do. And if that was Bulwark's attempt at sarcasm then he clearly hasn't mastered it yet
lmao that site is so NSFW
wtf they released the weekly newsletter but didn't announce the photo competition winner
They said they would
lol it's not a big deal, and it's probably good news for me
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-X2-00-Fidelio-Headphone-Black/dp/B00MRUPSHQ
£116.99 brand new
WHAT
THE
FUCK
I can't believe I just bought my endgame headphones for £116.99
That's less than 1/2 of the price of rory's HD600s which are the same tier of sound quality
That's fucking insane
These headphones are easily worth over £200 but I got them for only £116.99
No, why?
I would highly recommend you order these headphones now if you have any interest in them at all; you are very unlikely to find them this cheap any time soon
You'd be even more in heaven if you were listening to some Fidelio X2s
Super comfy, super amazing sounding
Damn that sucks
I'd probably kill myself if anything happened to my hearing
Amazing sound quality is amazing, isn't it rory?
rory knows because he has some good audio gear too
Are you there?
I prefer whatsapp because it's encrypted
How can they share data that is encrypted?

yay I've got my new mouse
But I am at work today :(
wtf why would I get a trackball?
I can't use my new mouse until after work :(
This is my new mouse http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g403-prodigy-wired-gaming-mouse
I finally found a worthy successor to my Logitech G400s
I wouldn't recommend buying Razer mice because Razer products are built cheaply
They generally won't last as long as a Logitech
On average, they last a lot less
Razer cheaps out on everything, always using lower quality switches and stuff
Do you use claw, fingertip, or palm grip?
Palm is more comfortable and better for accuracy IMO
Yeah I imagine not
Do you play FPS much?
I recommend Logitech G403 paired with a Corsair K65
You should probably get a separate mouse just for WoW then
A 12 button mouse is going to suck for FPS because of the weight and shape
wtf is wrt
We did?
So you're going to buy a light mouse then?
lmao
You should buy a seperate mouse for FPS then
135g is fucking heavy
So 105g?
wtf they put a 30g weight inside it?
Why?
DPI?
Using Synapse?
I usually just leave the DPI at default, no reason to change it
A lot of older mice like the Naga don't perform as well at other DPIs
The game doesn't matter wtf
Just change the in-game sensitivity and leave the DPI alone
It's better to change the in-game sensitivity for that
No need to change DPI
Then just change your game settings ffs
Oh then the developers are retarded
Not to include a zoom sens slider lmao
Na
Carrying it around as well as a smartphone is a hassle
You can get some phones with very good DACs nowadays
I'd rather buy a Fiio E17K or something and plug it into a phone
Or just use the phone's DAC if it's decent
I want a present
I can crack peoples' passwords and steal their monies
I use a randomly generated password for every site, which probably helps protect me against these dumps
What happened to him?
fuck
haha saw that last night
Nice
Thanks, need to mod it though
Cable is too stiff
Gonna put a new cable in it
I thought about going wireless
But I'll be happy with wired if the cable stops dragging I think
Wireless latency isn't too bad nowadays with Logitech mice
I have my cable attached to my monitor, but it's still a bit too stiff
What's a holiday account?
Aren't credit cards usually the best for that?
Don't credit cards give you low charges and good rates?
A good bed and a good chair will prevent decades of painful back pain
I wish good beds and good chairs were cheaper
I think the problem is that it's a thick braided cable. My G400s was a standard plastic cable which was much more flexible
The ceesa paracord looks like a nice little cable upgrade though
I'd go wireless, but the battery adds weight, the battery will slowly degrade over a couple of years, I'd need to plug it in to charge every now and then anyway
Bit of both.
The only thing I'm worried about is doing the heatshrinking part
I have to open the mouse up, unplug the old cable, heatshrink the new cable, and plug it in
Have to unscrew the PCB too
What do you think I should do. Mod the wired version or buy the wireless?
I can't return the wired one because my ebay seller doesn't accept returns
I found out that you can get XL pads for the V-Moda M100 which don't suck
So I might buy that and sell my M50X
What do you think of the V-Moda M100?
lmfao
If I still don't like the cable after modding it, what should I do with my G403?
Do you want to buy it?
IDK it's quite an expensive premium mouse, so I don't want to just give it away.
Recabled is actually better unmolested
The ceesa paracord is considered to be a significant upgrade
IDK where they got that. The cheapest I could find was £49 on ebay
I'm probably going to mod my G403 before deciding whether to buy the wireless one
I want a wired one that feels like wireless
So I get the advantages of both
I'd buy wireless if it wasn't so heavy and if the battery was easily replaceable
Wired is better in every way except for the cable drag
But if you get a really good cable with no friction and no weight, then it's ideal
That's what I'm trying to do
Is it bad if I get a cable without shielding?
No, the plasticised ones are generally better, it's the braided ones which are usually worse
The cable mod doesn't need soldering or anything. You just unplug the old cable and plug the new one in
It is braided
There's not a general rule that braided=bad and plastic=good
But generally OEM braided cables are worse
The paracord is custom made by a German to be really flexible and light
So it makes a wired mouse feel like wireless
Without all the drawbacks
If I'm still not completely satisfied with it, then maybe sell it for £50 or something
But IDK yet, I might be really pleased with it
I'll let you know
It's an absolutely fucking brilliant mouse
The specs are superior to everything else
It's superior to the Razer Deathadder and Zowie EC1A which are their flagship ergonomic FPS mice
It's way lighter
Yeah you made a good choice with the K65
I really like this keyboard
Even though I sent it back twice lmao
A really light mouse is less fatiguing in fast-paced FPS like Quake and Overwatch
Especially if you have a low sensitivity like me
The build quality is fantastic too. The rubber sides feel amazing, the shape hugs my hand, and the clicks are super tactile. Logitech's engineering team did a fantastic job
Zowie and Razer really need to step up their game now
oops sorry
Wait a bit first
let me do the cable mod and give you more information to make the best decision possible
The most important thing is you NEVER buy Razer
Razer products are all marketing and no engineering
Like Beats
They cheap out on stuff like switches so they wear down faster and don't perform as well
Yeah Logitech is the best mouse brand right now for sure
CSI Miami>Mr Robot
What soundcard/headset do you have?
Headset is a very important peripheral
More important than keyboard for sure, and possibly even more important than mouse!!!!
Why do you want a new mouse then wtf
I love the feel of the G403 clicks, it's like going from a membrane keyboard to a mechanical
They made them feel so good!
Do you palm grip?
Are you right handed?
Palm grip is most comfortable IMO
It's why I like ergonomic mice
It's shaped for your hand to wrap around it
It's where you rest part of your palm on the mouse
Instead of just the fingertips
It's more comfortable and probably better for your hand IMO
ffs my gf is angry with me because I don't want to ask my stepdad to borrow money for a house
Alcohol
Alcohol is the most dangerous drug, so it must be good!

You druggie
I don't do drugs other than protein and caffeine
I'm 5k in Dota, 3k in OW and 4k in CS:GO
My friend asked me to leave his house because I was browsing for drugs on the dark web
On his wifi
Same with alcohol and caffeine and tobacco and sugar m9
I was going to buy drugs FOR him as a present though!
Did you know that more people die from sugar in the UK than any other drug now?
Sugar-related heart disease is becoming an epidemic in the west
Sugar causes cancer!!!!
We should have hired Logitech to design our bodies. They do a fucking good job at designing their mice
yeah but mostly sugar, alcohol and tobacco
No
Must be shit because it's a romance

I ordered a new mouse cable for my Logitech G403 from a German
I bet you go the whole day at work without showering once
I always shower half way through the day to make sure I don't smell like you
My gf smells nice
Korean grils have a gene that prevents them from creating BO
Did you know that, rory?
Korean grils are genetically less stinky than white
East Asians (Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese) have fewer apocrine sweat glands (armpits, groin and earwax glands) compared to people of other descent, and the lack of these glands make East Asians less prone to body odor.[16][17]
No it's eugenics that rory likes
Yes you do, you advocate it all the time
If you were alive in the 30s, you would have supported Hitler
IDK what was his position on Asians?
Must be nice to blame anything you want on drugs and get away scott free
Any time you disagree with me, I'll just tell you I'm on caffeine
I think I might be allergic to coffee
Just had horrible shits

What's your experian credit score?
Do you have moneysavingsexpert Credit Club?
25 Aug 2016
24 Sep 2016
fuck
What's your credit score?
IDK if Noddle is comparable to Experian
Credit Club uses Experian and mine is 719, but should be higher now because it hasn't updated for ages
My score is 719 but Experian says it is a "poor" score :(
601 is terrible
I have 719 and it's "poor"
I have overdrafts and credit card
Why Barclaycard Platinum?
I gave up applying to Noddle because they couldn't confirm my identity
Thank god for moneysavingsexpert credit club
They just launched and it's still in beta
But it's free
Saving me £15 a month
I don't know, I never got accepted for Noddle
But Credit Club does affordability scores and % chance of accepting different products and stuff
IDK if Noddle does that
They could never confirm my identity
wtf reject me for paying in full?
But I want to improve my credit score....
Well I never intend to pay any interest on credit cards in my life
I'll get a mortgage within 6 months which will boost my score a shitload
Money Advice Service?
yeah moneysavingsexpert is really good

What are your best heroes?
Try to make sure you're good with at least one hero in every role, so you can be useful to your team
So make sure you can do lots of damage, support, flank, and initiate well
I'm pretty good with Ana, Tracer, Pudge, Zarya, Winston, Reaper and Soldier 76
And Pharah
Only Pharah? That's going to limit your mmr
You kinda want to play every hero at least a little bit to get a feel for their capabilities so you can play against them better
Zarya is fucking strong IMO
I often get 4 gold medals when I play her
She's probably amazing in your mmr bracket
Because noobs always give her extra damage
She's very good vs D.va, Rheinhardt, McCree, etc
She's probably my favourite hero now because she's great at both support and DPS
She's a super strong dueler
She also has good self-sustainability
Armour regenerates automatically
About 88 I think
What mouse do you have?
lmao
You need a Logitech G403
What are the dimensions of your Tecknet?
I created a spreadsheet containing specs of lots of mice so I could analyse what is the best mouse, but I could also use it to recommend you a mouse
Yeah but I'm gonna do the cable mod then get back to you
I'll make sure to find you a mouse worthy of being used for 5+ years
I might end up using my G403 for 3+ years if nothing else decent comes along
I'd be more interested in a G404 with some minor improvements
Do you have the dimensions of your mouse yet?
I doubt it's that much bigger than my G403
185 g
So it's about the same size as my G403 but over twice as heavy
Except the weight is bad, the buttons are bad, the sensor is bad, etc
And you're 1k mmr
Mouse limits your skill ceiling though
I'm a terrible player, but at least I'm not limited by a shitty mouse
Buy it on 0% purchase credit card
My new cable https://www.facebook.com/Mousecable/
Is this a good price? "1 X 250GB XBOX £50.00 FOR CONSOLE AND CONTROLLER "
Xbox 360 I think
It's in my company classifieds
I'm always checking it in case a cheap GTX 1080 or i7 6700k comes up
What?

What?
Oh congrats!
When you get to 3k you get a shiny badge
I wish Blizzard would seperate party and solo mmr
It's so much easier to rank up when you're in a party
mmr isn't really comparable if you don't know whether someone is playing solo or party
It's not about individual skill, but teamwork
Syncing pushes and ults and stuff
Sometimes nobody wants to do that if it's just a pub
Having fun is what is most important
They might sacrifice your flat for jihad

FUCK
FUCK AMAZON IN THE FUCKING FACE
Because I just lost like £80
Because of them

My gf is 30 and I'm 24
Tonight
I think /r/vegan is probably the biggest circlejerk on Reddit
My friend posts there a lot and he's such a circlejerker
I don't think /r/pcmasterrace is as much of a circlejerk as /r/vegan
In pcmastterrace there are sometimes people who enjoy consoles
It's not a 100% circlejerk and the mods try to prevent that
But /r/vegan is 100% circlejerk
You will not find a single person saying they enjoy meat in there. If you do, they will be called a troll and downvoted heavily.
Not true in /r/pcmasterrace
Stop trolling omg
Insider threats like Edward Snowden?
Always stealing your top secret shady plans!#
This is the sort of build you should go for I think https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/b/bgM8TW
Probably the most performance you can get from a sub 20L build
You could probably OC a CPU to 5GHz in that
That's why I go to the gym during my lunch break
Nobody bothers me in the gym
It's just the same instructions as on most food

Are you excited for SpaceX's mission?
I'd love to see a base on Mars
It's not just Mars though. Having a permanent base on Mars will open up Jupiter's moons and the rest of the solar system
Having a permanent base on Mars will act as an incentive to bring down the cost of space travel
All the R&D could bring improvements to all sorts of technology
omg my student discount gives me 45% off Parcelforce

Where can I buy some cheap swimming shorts?
The hotel I booked my gf and I into has a swimming pool
Sister's wedding
Just some cheap place
Yes
My mother, father, and brother all got married abroad
My gf always is
IDK probably
Got more important stuff to do first
I don't want to make babies wtf
Like buying a house and upgrading my PC
I'd like to go on a holiday too at some point
Once I've sorted out my house
Maybe Turkey, I heard it's on offer atm
Korea would be fun
My friend got such good value tickets to Tunisia last year
Then a crazy terrorist started shooting people at his resort
I'd go to Shanghai
Yeah, but he was on a boat at the time
Yeah you're unlikely to get hurt even if you're at the same resort as an attack
oh wtf I have to call/book with tastecard
Can't just turn up
I love the student discount, I just have to show them my student ID in the store
lmao have to book a dining time
Lots of stores
 https://www.myunidays.com/
Yeah but you can be a student at any age
Tastecard is too restrictive...
Stupid booking in advance

Fucking hell that subreddit is so retarded
Well I certainly don't condone nuclear warfare
LMFAO https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/4sbh54/the_simpsons_never_disappoint/
I just can't take this subreddit seriously
It's like they're all pretending to be as retarded as possible or something
Even though they are foreign?
wtf is that crazy language they're speaking
Maybe it'll keep the kids off crack, heroin and crystal meth
Education is never a bad policy IMO
That opinion is not general concensus though
IDK if they do hard drugs they might be risking their health?
Do you think they'll do crystal meth?
Probably good to start on the soft stuff
They'll kick it up a notch soon
We should rent a botnet to suggest crystal meth
What's the hardest drug, crack or crystal meth?
Heroin maybe?
Marijuanna?
It's amazing how many people are addicting to sugar and alcohol but nobody thinks it's a problem and it's killing hundreds of thousands of people in the UK every year

Do you work in IT?
IDK does it count as IT?
WHAT THE FUCK
WHY
 Please may I have free beer and pizza too?
My mum doesn't care where you work
please
If I come to London, will I get free beer and pizza?
What's happening tonight? Is Google announcing their new phones?
I doubt they'll be anything special
Shit dac, shit amp, no waterproofing
Not really
They should at least be good
IDK why they even bother
I'd rather have an HTC
Maybe if they put a good DAC inside it and waterproof it
Out of a cannon?
omg why are so many of my customers retired at 60
Hey my ceesa cable arrived last night
I mean yesterday morning
I'm gonna go for it
I wanna get an even fatter pension and get ridiculous mortgage rates
I'll be as rich as rory even with half his salary hahahahha
IDK yet haven't looked
Was just looking at their staff benefits
Are you there?
wtf
Source?
USB-C is fine
If Samsung puts 2 ports into the phone, then it'll be pretty good
We'll still be able to use the phone's AMPDAC and charge the phone at the same time
But it'll also mean we can connect two devices into the phone without a hub adapter
And it'll save space in the phone for a bigger battery
The problem with the iphone is that Lightning is a proprietary standard, requires an external AMPDAC, and only has one port
IDK maybe this? https://www.nationwide-jobs.co.uk/jobs/customer-analysis/data-quality-analyst/?sType=Indeed

£30 TV that's a pretty good price

ffs I wish I didn't add Scott from work on Steam. Now he can see when I open up games when I'm working from home
I might unfriend him
I never play with him anyway; he's a filthy casual
What's best, Ubuntu or Debian?
I feel dirty when I tell people I use Ubuntu...
I feel like I should be using Debian
Yeah I like how things are more likely to work on Ubuntu, so I can spend more time gaming and less trying to get some stupid proprietary game to stop fucking up over some minor issue
I wish Blizzard would support Linux
Did you hear that your favourite game is getting replays and crowdfunding soon?
IDK what that is
wtf you can't do that?
You said it's "coming back"
1=solo
So atm it's never 1-1-1-1-1 vs 1-1-1-1-1-1 but it will be soon?
But it will be enforced soon?
How else are 4 people going to queue without a solo player?
Think about it for a second
If there's 5 people in a team, but only 4 people in a party, then someone MUST be solo
It's only a problem if the players make it a problem
omg I'm working from home today and my mum decides to randomly get an electricition to do some work and cuts off all the power and internet without telling me
Got to set up my powerline adapter again later too ffs
Time to go back to bed?
You can build a pretty good PC that will blow any console out of the water for like £300
IDK why people still buy consoles
Entry level PC gaming is pretty cheap nowadays
Even £210 will get you something decent enough
AMD A8-7670K 3.6GHz Quad Core APU
Something like this https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/
Lose the keyboard and mouse and it's ~£210
Good enough for 60FPS in CS:GO, Dota, Overwatch, Rocket League, etc
You could bring the cost down to <£150 if you wanted to get a a lower spec APU
Sorry http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/mKv4pb
CPU with integrated graphics
AMD APUs are better performance than cheap dedicated graphics
So it's better to get an APU unless you're spending £300 or more
I'd recommend spending £300 or more though
APUs are for casuals
TRhat's pretty expensive
That's really fast RAM, because there's no VRAM with APUs
You need fast RAM for the graphics
You can get 8GB for £30
8GB is the amount I recommend for budget gamingf
I recommend 16GB if you have more to spend because it's so cheap and why not
8GB is fine
Most people don't need more than 8GB atm
You should tell your friend to spend a bit more and get a build like this http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/user/samburnett/saved/w4sJxr
You get more RAM, bigger HDD, faster CPU, and better graphics
I'd also recommend spending £1,000 for a PC if you have the money. You want to get an i7 6700k and GTX 1070
And an SSD and 16GB of RAM
And a really big CPU cooler so you can OC your 6700K as high as possible
Yeah sure man, I just need to play a couple of ranked OW matches
Just don't do anything hasty
Wanna play with me?
wtf?
sure, add me
Samsung#2781
This cable is wayyyyyyyyy better
I'm pretty happy with my mouse now I think
But I would recommend the wireless G403 unless you want to mod the wired's cable
There's only like 5 other people in the world who have a mouse with specs as good as mine
HansProleman wants to buy a new mouse and I am advising him
Buy the wired one, or buy the wired one and mod it
Don't buy the wired one if you're not gonna mod it, because the cable sucks
I'll probably play later, got to walk the dog and stuff now
Thanks for the games
Yeah, the cable is a bit heavy and not flexible enough, so it adds drag and makes your mouse feel heavier
And the wireless version is very very good. It's ~20g heavier but has zero cable drag and very low latency
Get a used one for £70-£80
You want a mouse that is effortless to move around
You don't want it to be heavy and resist your movement
Why not get the wired one and mod it?
A little bit of additional setup for years of having the best mouse in the world is worth it IMO
You can get a used wireless one for £77.66 on Amazon
Or a used wired one for £49.14
The difference between the stock cable and the Ceesa cable is huge. It makes the wired version feel like wireless because there's almost no cable drag
I'm really happy with how this mod turned out
I think I'm going to use this mouse for a long time
Holy shit http://bankaccountsavings.co.uk/calculator

Santander started it all when they reduced from 3% to 1.5%
fuck Brexit
now TSB is going down from 5% to 3% and reducing the max amount by £500
Into a fund, or specific shares?
I doubt that's more efficient than a fund
There are people whose jobs involve buying and selling shares. There's no way you can beat the investment of a trader
fuck that's expensive
omg http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37627308
Why did we leave the EU again?
Stop trolling
Dota 2 has a new compendium and Overwatch has the Halloween event with limited-edition skins. I might book some annual leave to farm all the skins
IDK it gives no competitive points and low XP
The first game I played people were just wasting their ultis too
reminds me of TF2 MvM
And Killing Floor
The skins are getting ridiculous though
It's going to be a massive problem soon, especially when more heroes are added and people can switch heroes at random
Skins are going to make it harder to recognise heroes
Especially because all the heroes are humans too....
All humans, can switch unlimited times in-game, 6v6, and radical skins
I forsee a big visibility problem coming soon
Blizzard are going to need to disable skins in tournamnets at this rate
Their weapons do change
They look different
Some of the skins can affect the sounds
?
wtf why do I have a missed call from a number belonging to "Multiple Sclerosis Society Of Great Britain & Northern Ireland"

Do I need a TV license for Filmon TV?
https://www.filmon.com/
fuck
Was hoping I could save £150 a year by not buying it
Yeah
I don't watch any TV atm anywya
I'd mostly just get it for my gf
I'm thinking of installing Stremio on a Raspberry PI and connecting it to a TV
Is that a good idea, rory?
IDK, why wouldn't it?
Isn't the Pi3 quite powerful?
I prefer Stremio, it makes everything so easy
Stremio does a pretty good job of finding sources for most films. I've struggled with Kodi
What does he mean by "higher resolution"?
I don't need more than 1080p
xbmc=old kodi?
Yeah I might get a Chromecast
But does Chromecast let me install a VPN on it?
This will be released one day http://circle.strem.io/
Protection from MFAA
?
Right about what?
I thought it streamed from the Chromecast itself?
Does it support Bittorrent?
Stremio supports Netflix I think
And Filmon supports Channel 4 I think
https://www.reddit.com/r/Stremio/comments/46812s/introducing_netflix/
http://addons.strem.io/
Twitch, Youtube, Netflix, Filmon, etc
5 month old source
IDK
What's 4od?
IDK why you'd want to watch that pleb shite
You can just watch the shows on torrent sources I guess
4od has ads, doens't it?
wow that's awful
4od sounds like a really shady company, like Riot
Does that mean Filmon won't be able to stream BBC channels soon?
IDK
Do I need a TV license to use Filmon?
Why?
I wouldn't mind open plan so much if the headset they gave me didn't have zero isolation

I'm going to work a 3 day week for the next 3 weeks
Gonna get all the OW skins
I have a surplus of holiday days anyway
Might as well take some time off and earn some skins
wtf
Why?
Did you buy them?
I'm going to wait until the last day and buy them all at once, so I don't drop duplicates
You're not gonna play OW at all for 3 weeks?
You get event lootboxes even for playing ranked mm
You get event lootboxes for unranked too
It makes no sense to buy until the last day of the event
If you don't play the game, why did you buy lots of lootboxes?
Damn that sucks
WoW is for nerds
He's a race traitor
I just signed up for TPS and Silentguard
Hopefully people will stop calling me and telling me I had a car accident now

Has your G403 arrived yet?
Damn, that happened to me too....
I got something delivered to the office, then I couldn't be arsed to go get it
Filthy casual
wtf so you're not getting your G403 for another week?
You need a G403!!!!!
Wanna play OW tonight?
I've booked a 4 day weekend to get as many OW skins as possible
Valve just released the new Inferno in CS:GO
Baths take a long time
I'd prefer to do a bath if I didn't have to run it
And if I didn't have to pay for the water
Fucking degenerate

wtf is forced password iteration?
Oh I hate that
Work makes us do it and we all just add a number to the end and increase it by 1 each time
I wouldn't mind it if I could log in using Lastpass or osmething
But fuck having to remember a different password every 90 days
There's no way you can do that and have people pick secure and memorable passwords
It's a total clusterfuck
I wish I could use lastpass to log into my work laptop
Yeah I think so too
Or even three factor
password+physical key+biometric
Something you know, something you have, and something you are
Although a lot of people will argue that the biometric is redundant
But since you always have it with you, why not?
Might foil an attack
Although I guess it would suck if you lose your eye on the way to work and aren't able to log in that day because of it
Yeah good point, probably not worth it
Unless you have so much money and your security is so valuable
Haha it was just an example m9
Retinal might come down in cost if smartphones start mass producing it
Yeah using fingerprint to encrypt your phone is stupid
What happens to your smartphone if the police arrests you?
Do they keep it charged?
wtf how do they have a forensic copy?
Wouldn't they have to take it apart?
They'd have to unsolder the SSD from the motherboard....
Yeah imaging a hard drive is ez
Doesn't that rely on the phone's firmware allowing reading of the SSD through the USB port?
Doesn't sound like it'd be usable for police/secret service/government evidence
You'd have to assume two things. 1) the phone will let you just read from the SSD directly through the USB. And 2) that the firmware won't modify the data in any way during transfer
The only way to be sure would be to open the phone, unsolder the SSD, and make a proper image
Unless it's Apple?
Even with fingerprint lockscreen, the government can't get into your phone once it runs out of battery
wtf
No way the police have such advanced equipment
lmfao
This will ruin the show
The reason why Rick and Morty is so good is because it's written by men
They should hire Korean grils to write S3
Would be amazing
I made an offer for a flat
But they aren't going to accept it, because there are too many cash buyers and first time buyers
Yeah I offered to take all the stuff in the flat so they don't need to spend money on removing everything
I didn't know there was as much competition until after I made the offer
I was hoping to at least get a counter offer
I might just leave it and wait until the next flat if I can't afford to compete with the other bidders
nice racism m9
wtf
my offer was rejected and it was sold to a cash buyer for 105k :(
The person who just bought the flat I wanted to buy
Yeah that
wtf
you druggie
That's why you don't do drugs m9
do your parents know your a drug addict?
Iota is a race traitor too
me too
I don't tip because it's the employer's job to pay their staff properly
What yield do you get from your stock market trading? Have you ever considered using ratesetter.com at 5.5%?
oh wtf it was 5.5% yesterday and now 4.7%
I don't want to go to Australia because it's too hot and I don't like scary animals
Good CPU but shit GPU
And ofc you can always build a faster and cheaper one yourself
Better and cheaper http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/jqW2kT
Why are you looking at pre-builts wtf
You can build your own so much cheaper, especially if you buy your CPU and GPU second hand
You could easily build a PC just as good but £200 cheaper
He's a filthy casual then
Just tell him to buy a gaming laptop
Razer Blade Stealth or some shit
Or Alienware
The GPU in that PC will be a bottleneck though
Also, IDK what he'll be using the PC for
It's very expensive for such a bad gaming PC
You're paying for a Windoze license too
That's a lot of money
same
piracy ftw
I've never paid for a Microsoft license
Still use all their shit
Is it actually illegal, or is it just frowned upon?

I talk to a lot of cute Chinese grills on Wechat

What amp are you thinking of getting?
Schitt stack?
You should get some Beyer Custom One Pros
They're so good
I love them
I wish I could find something similar that folded
Or maybe I'll get some CIEMs and just use those whenever I'm out
Yeah same, it's what you need for FPS
That's why I bought my K702s
Largest soundstage and most detailed mid-fi cans
oh shit http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37728010
Dirty cow lmao who comes up with these names
The Beyer Custom One Pros are great. You get good isolation. You get the choice of bright sound signature, which is great for gaming if you also need the isolation in a noisy environment. You get neutral if you like neutral sound signature, you get a bass boost if you like to have a little emphasised bass like I do and makes them sound a lot 
like the DT770s, and you get bass heavy for bassheads
The headband and earpads are super comfortable and easy to replace like the DT770s
And the cable is standard 3.5mm which is super useful for portability, replacement, and for turning into a gaming headset with a V-moda Boompro!
You can also customise the faceplates, but that's not really a selling feature for me
16ohms so can be run by literally naything too
I'm really happy I sold my DT770s for these
I might sell my M50X too, since they aren't quite up to the spec I wanted them to be
fucking hell it's noisy in my office this morning
I wish everyone would stfu
I'm worried I might have diabetes. I'm getting checked next week.
omg I have a 15% student discount at KFC
You got all the halloween OW skins yet?
I'm just missing Roadhog, Zenyetta, Ana, Bastion and Pharah
When clocks go back, does that mean I get an extra hour to sleep?
And does that make it lighter or darker in the morning?
fuck
Dark mornings just make getting out of bed even harder
End BST?
I'm in favour of that
All it does is confuse me
omg I have a 19.25% discount on KFC
15% student discount and 5% contactless cashback
omgggggggggg
I'm getting tested for diabetes next week
obesity
Yeah I'm not worried about type 1
More type 2
I've eaten wayyyyyyyyyyy too much sugar
I am at risk!
Have you been secretly weighing me?!?!?

I bet I've consumed more sugar than you
BIG DADDY MEAL OMFG <3
I think I'm going to apply for HSBC current account again today
I hope it gets approved, because I would like a free £150
I was rejected last time :(
I only have until the end of the month to claim my £150
Well they want £1750 deposited a month, and I only get £1246 salary after deductions
What's the difference?
Why not?
Did you try to get the switching bonus too?
Can't I just say my salary is 30k and deposit £1750 in anyway/
Will the car cleaner clean my car even though my car is filthy?

Not enough time!!!!
omg the hotel just emailed me to tell me their swimming pool will be out of order on the days I booked
My gf and I bought swimsuits just so we can use their pool
Yeah I'm thinking of using a public pool
But I would prefer to use what I paid for

I'd like to go to China
China has more attractive grills
lmfao no
Asian>white
?
Didn't a referendum already decide that?
wat
I thought 51% was all that was needed, so things could keep changing constantly
?
Wat
ffs my internet fucked up yesterday, so I lost a couple of hours of OW skin farming
I almost have them all
Got 5.5k gold to spend
If i can just find Roadhog then I'll save 3k gold
IDK whether the event will be repeated next year, so it's hard to decide whether to save or spend
IDK if I'll be able to get these skins again
Maybe I should save for Christmas
I bet there'll be Christmas skins
What holiday wtf
Not holiday, only annual leave
And I still don't have the Roadhog halloween skin
IDK might just buy it
What's the point of having gold then
Do you enjoy the money?
I probably wouldn't bother working if it didn't give me an income
I want to go work for Nationwide
Subsidised cafeteria, 0.5% mortgage, 23% pension, and on-site gym omg
The company benefits at Nationwide are insane
Can you get Subway to make you a sandwich with weed?
I know you can order it in Amsterdam
Is weed edible?
Can you overdose on it?
Can you give someone marijuanna intoxication against their will?
lmao rekt
2 drowned and 2 were crushed, pretty brutal
They have a shitload of failsafes on rollercoasters
The simpler rides are the more dangerous
yay I get paid £1,300 this month because of mileage
I might need to open a new bank account to store all my extra money soon
Do you have Nationwide regular saver? Up to £500 a month at 5%
wtf are cheetos
I have a wedding and a gf this weekend lmao
IDK you'll have to look into it
Probably if it's not a regular saver
Martin's money saving tips?
My TSB regular saver will mature in December :(
My First Direct regular saver matured yesterday
Got £3720 to put somewhere now
Gonna fill up my Nationwide current account probably
Nationwide regular saver would be perfect for you then
Are you getting the Co-Op and Halifax monthly bonuses? ez £7 a month that way
Even with no savings in there
omg that face http://www.ability-housing.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/b2b-brochure.pdf
omg the man who sits behind me got their hair dyed and a sex change today
Actually, it might just be a different person sitting at his desk
occams razor
When driverless cars are invented, we can sleep on the way to work
And have a coffee made for us
Or make a coffee ourselves whilst on the way to work
Or play video games in the car
The possibilities are limitless
The problem ATM is that I have to concentrate on driving, so it's hard to do all that fun stuff simultaneously
wtf
Are you being serious
Oh you mean a motorbikje?
I thought you meant a bicycle lmao
Yeah, motorbikes will be banned first
But maybe with driverless cars, the share of accidents that are motorbikes might fall
But it's definitely a possibility that motorbikes will be banned one day
FUCK THaTS AMAZING OMG
I fucking love beef jerky
How much do you get?
omg
Wish there was a Tesco near me
I want a large Sugar Free energy drink, a meat sandwich, and a pck of beef jerkey
I've heard good things about them, but I probably wouldn't spend that much on a single pair
And I definitely wouldn't order them without trying them first
I could recommend you some decent headphones for like 1/10th of the price
I prefer to have a few sets of mid-fi cans than one pair of summit-fi
The problem with spending all your money on one pair is that you are then limited to the sound signature and features of only one pair
Whereas I like to have different sound signatures, different levels of isolation and soundstage and portability
Why do you watch Fear the Walking Dead instead of just Walking Dead?
I heard The Expanse is good
IDK if you skip the first 5 series and just start on the 6th then the show is okay
The problem with Walking Dead is that there's lots of character development about characters nobody cares about and then they randomly kill them off and nobody gives a shit
Making the whole thing pointless
At least in GoT the characters killed off are actually interesting and relevant
No you don't understand, every day in the post-zombie-apocalypse is a fight for survival
Why not just drive?
If you have an economical car like mine, you actually make a good profit with the mileage expenses
FUCK just crashed my car
Drove into the back of someone
1-2mph
an hour ago
I couldn't see very well because of the sun glare
Regular
More flexible, and probably cheaper
A display should just be a display
Smart TVs are a dumb idea IMO
I concur
Get Stremio Circle

How do I urinate in a sample bottle without getting it on the outside at all?
I need a funnel or something
Is what good?
No idea, it's just the cheapest I could find on Amazon
Haven't even looked at it
Stop posting NSFW links pls
I don't trust you
Really sad because I had a car crash this morning
Really happy because my tests show I am very healthy and definitely not diabetic
Sun got in my eyes, I lowered the sun visor and slowed down and hit them going about 1-2mph
under 25 insurance excess is so high
Gonna lose my no claims discount too
My car seems fine, but the other person's car has a ~2 inch crack on the bumper
All the days
It's mandatory I take them ALL
The office shuts down
oh fuck
15% student discount at KFC
I'm collecting chicken stamps
Cleaners don't know what elipsises are
Oh you're asking what the elipsis is for
Sorry, I think I misread
Yeah, that is a weird response
I think she's just trying to be sassy
Or just being sassy
Yes
You hired a sassy cleaner
Looks interesting, I'll give it a read when I have time
Thanks m9
Why don't you just clean your flat yourself?
£20 is so much money though
It takes me three hours to earn £20
That's almost half my day at work
IDK there's a lot to analyse there
About 10
I cleaned my car last night
Just the windshield
I made 9001% on an investment on a CS:GO skin
Okay probably around 6 hours then
Yeah that's why I'm 5k mmr
Also why I have such a sexy gf
Yeah because Joey Barton is so admired
Na, streamers don't make more money, otherwise pros would stream more
Or just retire after making a couple of mil
LoL is different because the prize money is so low
Yet the game has a huge casual audience
In Dota, it's the other way around
Pros don't stream because they focus on competition
I can play with you some time
This weekend maybe?
I can tell you how to do the basics
We will play Dota next weekend then
The cheapest, then spend your money on more important stuff
Yeah, spend more money on mice and stuff
Get a 7700K and a GTX 1080
7700K and GTX 1060 is good too
Run everything on lowest graphics
wtf
Get 300FPS it's so good
https://blog.lastpass.com/2016/11/get-lastpass-everywhere-multi-device-access-is-now-free.html/
You use keepass then?
I like it because it works better with Android apps than Lastpass
In Keepass you have to copy and paste your password, whereas in Lastpass it comes up as an overlay
Automatic login too, so you don't have to remember your password manager's password
Whereas in Keepass I have to type in a really long password every time I boot it up
Does Keepass have form autofill too?
I can use Lastpass to automatically fill forms for me
And automatically log me into websites
Lastpass is just really simple to use
Makes password management a breeze
77.8% return from Property Moose wow
Hmmm not sure. Try liquipedia, gosugamers and hltv
Actually
www.esportsearnings.com
Probably best
Yeah I saw
I won't be renewing until next July
Since my insurance is so low, any gains would be nullified by admin fees anyway
This is really beneficial for people paying hundreds of £
I got mine fully comprehensive and £100 excess for £186
I got such a good deal at the time considering I'm under 25
Check out my insurer's website http://www.diamond.co.uk/
I added my mum and stepdad to my policy which brought the cost down a lot too
No
I think they have an api
What are you trying to do?
Yeah
That's how I got my insurance so low
holy fuck
Are you on EE's central server or osmething?
My insurance covers me for business use too
wow
I don't think I'd actually make use of it though
Bandwidth is irrelevant for gaming, and my slow connection is fine for Stremio
You can watch Youtube in 1080p fine even with a shit line like mine
Youtube is so heavily compressed
How do you know my car insurance is such a good deal if you've never bought car insurance?????
wtf?
I haven't had a problem with 1080p youtube for years
And I live in the middle of fucking nowhere
wtf but that's a city
Oh fuck I just got a car insurance quote for £500
Bit worried about the coming July now
Gonna get another quote
£356.40 per year
That's without adding in my parents
I think I'll be fine
My insurance might go up by like £50
Or maybe even £100
But that's not too big of a deal in the grand scheme of things lmao
I only pay like £25 in petrol a month
Unless I go to Brighton or something
Like 6 miles to work each day
Your bike might have more mpg than my car, but it has less miles per fatality
And didn't die
If you get hit by me, you will die
If I hit you, you're more likely to die than me
No, it's going to be an accident
omg stop trolling
Your bike is less safe
Remember to tell them your retarded too
No, it's because you don't have a steel frame to protect you, and you have a smaller visual footprint
It's simple physics
Bus drivers never die
For a price
Yes both of those
Bikes are like 10 times more dangerous to drive than cars
HOMETIME

VW engine?
What do you think about your G403?
Both candidates are shit
What games will you test your G403 out with tonight?
I recommend Quake Live or Overwatch
Lots of mouse movement
Or CS:GO DM
ignore Iota, he's trolling you
And how often does that happen? Like once every 10 minutes?
HansProleman needs constant movement to really get a good feel for the mouse
Why did you buy the mouse I recommended you and not just some Razer shit then?
I can recommend you a really shit casual mouse if you want
I love how with the G403 you can map all the buttons and change all the LED settings and DPI and everything, and it'll store on the mouse itself so it'll work on any PC you plug it into
So after the initial setup, you can use it driverless just fine
K65 has play/pause
Use the function key
play/pause, next track, previous track, etc
It's all there
Just two buttons instead of one
I'd prefer a single button, but whatever
Volume is more important
Did you get what you wanted from that website?
Yeah the drivers are great. You only really need them to tweak the settings on the mouse's internal storage, and to update firmware
What are you modelling exactly?
It's the Korean team every time
IDK maybe the top 2-3 Korean teams
I don't think there's a Linux driver
After the initial setup, I haven't needed to use the drivers again anyway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePpPVE-GGJw
ffs I keep having to get up and walk around to turn the office lights back on
Hillary and Donald are such fucks
Mine lmao

wtf
Stop doing drugs omg
What do you spend all your money on?
hahaha I watched that like a week ago
Love that film, it reminds me of myself
Because I'm an adult still living with my parents
I'm thinking about adding data validation to this spreadsheet, but I might not because people will just complain because they don't know how to use it
Nobody at my company knows how to use Excel apart from in finance
Yeah but I have a feeling someone will tell me that they aren't able to put comments in the cell value or something
Does anyone else hate it when people put comments into cell values?
It makes formula and conditional formatting and data validation and everything impossible
lmao then they will just complain they can't do it and tell me to undo what I've done
We have a lot of dates for supplier certifications, so I like to keep just the date in there so I can actually produce some meaningful reports with it. My colleague kept putting in text with the date, which makes it impossible to use formula. I took this text out and added it as a comment for the cell instead, but was told to remove a
ll the comments because she doesn't like using comments
So IDK what the solution is
I like using comments if text is required for a cell
Colleague puts them IN the cell, I put them attached to the cell
I only want dates in these cells, comments can go in the "Notes" column or added as a comment
Yeah gonna put data validation everywhere
Might get in trouble for it
IDK someone will complain that they can't write an essay in a cell that should be the expiry date of an insurance document or something
But I want people to like me because I have such low self esteem
Can I use data validation to select from a list but also accept dates?
From a list, but also dates
So just a list + dates
A list of dates between 2000 and 2030 would be good
Don't need any earlier/later than that
Yeah but I need to put specific text in too sometimes
So I want a list + a date range
Fuck that
Can I put formula like = DATE OR "XXX" ?
If Brexit can happen, Trump can be USA president
This is catchy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_7WwPkqqvA
Yeah better than their other videos I think
Get a G3258 or whatever it is and OC it to like 5GHz
Then pair it with a second hand GPU from ebay
Wow sucks
970/980/980TI probably
IDK
My CPU just survived an 8 hour stress test, so hopefully it'll stop crashing now
Why not?
It finds system stability so I can increase voltage if necessary
No
My gf is 31 today
People should wipe their consoles before reselling them
That's creepy
Google is tracking you
If I wanted to kidnap you, all I'd have to do is look at your history to see where you go, then prepare an ambush
I got a text from Tesco this morning
I bank with everyone
I'm switching from Tesco to Co-Op today, I hope Tesco doesn't fuck it up
thanks m9
I work 10 seconds away from a 12-hour gym
Not medically at least
"obese" is a medical term, not an insult
I just got tested for obesity and am obesity negative
Diabetes negative too
About 74kg and 6 feet
Want me to scan and email my medical records over to you?
Sure, I'll get them posted to me soon
thanks m9
lmao
I don't have dxracer or mountain dew
I switched to a low sugar diet last year as a pre-emptive measure
I got my blood sugar tested last week and it's nice and low :)
My obesity has been cured too
Lost so much weight
She is very attracted to me
I don't think she cares too much
She hasn't ever complained
If I don't have a tv license and have a lodger, who gets prosecuted if the lodger watches TV?
No, just curiosity
hello
Sure
I know more about what games require than servers
I wouldn't class that as small form factor
That case is over 3X the size of mine
This one is smaller and supports 10 3.5" drives https://www.cclonline.com/product/178946/PC-Q26A/Cases/Lian-Li-PC-Q26A-Mini-ITX-Chassis-Silver/CAS2281/?siteID=8BacdVP0GFs-5xUyDm6wziJIUKo4F39keA
These are the cases you should be looking at https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/products/case/#t=9,12,10&J=5,20&sort=d4&page=1
But matx can be cheaper
I pretty much just run my system off a single 2.5" SSD
I don't use much space nowadays because my internet connection is pretty good
This case supports 3X3.5" and 3X2.5" and it's fucking tiny https://www.ncases.com/
Not usually, but I can make an exception for you
I'm pretty busy in the evening, and the best way to contact me is Steam or Whatsapp or Weechat
.I
Do you need 3.5" drives? You can get pretty large 2.5" drives nowadays https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01BVS7868/?tag=pcp0f-21
And you can fit two 2.5" drives in a 3.5" slot
So you know that 10 3.5" drive case I linked earlier? You can put 20 4TB 2.5" drives in there for 80TB of storage
Or 20TB for £370 https://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Storage/Hard+Drives/3.5+Inch+SATA+Drives/1.5TB+-+8TB/2TB+Toshiba+DT01ACA200+3.5%22+SATA+III+Hard+Drive+-+PULL+HDD?productId=65666
Why do you need so much storage anyway?
reported to network admins
You can put 4X2TB disks in an Ncase M1 easily
And a 240mm AIO
lmao it looks completely different
fuck brexit
I think I ran that program on / before
IIRC I had to reinstlal
I love how USA gets the choice of of just two shitheads
Why two lmao
Two is so limiting
FPTP is pretty broken
Everyone should get 20 votes with preferential order
20 preferential votes
wtf?
are you retarded?
God who thought that poster would be a good idea?
Does AV really cost £250m more than FPTP?
I call BS
Rupert Murdoch?
So weird how you can put obviously false figures everywhere and still win
You'd think someone would call them out on their BS
But they still won?
wtf I don't understand the world
Is it Rupert Murdoch?
?
Why did you ask me to be online in the evening if you won't talk to me?
lmao I told my gf she's special and she thought it was a compliment
lmao what?
She loved it
lmao Donald Trump is USA president 2016
God help us all
What kind of sick world do we live in where Donald Trump becomes USA president instead of Bernie Sanders
He
He's so fuckign old
75
I wonder if Donald Trump would have lost if Bernie Sanders had been the candidate
It's dumb how the party decides the candidate like that
So the two candidates are decided undemocratically before the election
It doesn't seem like a very democratic system
It seems even worse than what we have in the UK
Yeah me neither really
Vladmir Putin wanted Donald Trump to win
lmfao that's what I thought
Donald Trump hates China wtf
Why would anyone hate China wtf
Not much worse than a two party state
USA is only one more party
Not really
When was the last time a party other than the main two was elected?
It was never
No, I'm talking about USA
Do they have a house of lords in USA?
I wonder if USA only elected donald because they didn't want to be outdone in stupidity by the UK
USA always has to be #1
omg it's 9/11 today
Get a Zowie G-TFX
Steelseries mouse pads aren't one of the most any more
Zowie make some really good ones
I'm sure you can get it cheaper elsewhere
Where is it £20?
I wouldn't recommedn the Qck nowadays, it's popular because it was super popular years ago
Yeah it's the wrong one
Have a look for the Zowie G-SR that one is pretty good
https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Keyboard-Mouse-Accessories/BenQ-ZOWIE-G-SR-Pad-e-Sports/B01D2B9IO2/
I've heard good things about this one, but haven't tried it for myself http://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-xl-gaming-mouse-mat
I'd recommend Zowie mousepads though
I've also heard very good things about the mousepads on this site https://www.artisan-jp.com/
Just don't buy a fucking Qck
lmfao https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5byr0o/good_to_know_that_to_the_american_public_the_most/
Did you get my call?
no it was me omg
wtf
I bet against the teams I want to win quite often
Can't see pics of the other side so I'm not sure what type of cooler it has
Ah it's a big double fan cooler
Make sure you have a large well-ventilated case for that, otherwise it'll heat up your other components
It's a good card, just don't overpay for it
Probably £280 absolute limit
Beyond that I'd probably recommend a GTX 1070 at like £315
The GTX 1070 is nice because of how power efficient the Pascall architecture is
Actually, I'm not sure if you can get a GTX 1070 that cheap
Check how much a GTX 1070 costs, then don't go near/above that
I'm sure an ebay GTX 980 will get you a shitload bang for your buck
There's a new official Ubuntu version now http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/11/ubuntu-budgie-now-official-ubuntu-flavor
Probably because they made the discs before the game finished development
Diff patching is harder
It's easier to just be lazy
Tesco
http://bankaccountsavings.co.uk/calculator
hahahahahaha https://twitter.com/JonnyCruzzz/status/796096902794080256
You should consider P2P too
2.7% https://www.ratesetter.com/invest/everyday-account
3.1% https://www.zopa.com/lending
The risk is pretty negligable
Then why are you worried about Tesco?
Haha
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyKt8_ZLxUg
Yes
Why doesn't it just use RAM?
It only has to cache once, right?
I think the problem is that Spotify has a licensing restriction where it's not licensed to store more than 3,000 tracks on a machine at a time
So they have to rewrite over it constantly
IDK
Not really
I tried to download 10,000 songs and Spotify told me to go fuck myself
Would I get in trouble for installing Dota on my work laptop? I need to manage my fantasy Dota team when I go visit my Korean gf
No omg my gf is in Brighton
I don't think he's coming back
How are you coping with the G403's cable, and have you decided on a mousepad yet?
I recommend buying the Ceesa cable and a Zowie G-TFX
What is your preferred sound signature?
Why don't you go ahead and make a draft build on pcpartpicker?
Can you give me a spec at least? size, amount of drives, performance, price, etc?
I can put a draft build together
Sure
me too haha
Except my game isn't shit like yours
Did you get the HD6XX on Massdrop for $199?
Why not?
I would have got them if I didn't already have my heart set on the Fidelio X2s
They're similar to the Fidelio X2s AFAIK
Is it matx?
wow what a shit game
100 gorillion players and 20 minute queue time
I queued 20 seconds
Already half way through my game
Buggy shit game
IDK why you play it
Adele likes pie
omg when I have my Beyer Custom One Pros in and listen to kpop, I have no idea how loud my farts are
I wonder if I'm annoying people near me
nice
I like Jolin Tsai
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c86t8hoVw8E
There's a lot of cute grils where you live
Would you ever date an Asian?
I didn't watch the video, I just listened to it on Spotify
I should be working, not watching Youtube videos lmao
My CPU vcore is up to 1.284v now, and I might need to raise it higher if it keeps crashing in X264 :(
I want to keep it below 1.3v
haha same
I play Dota
Yeah I came in because I have a meeting today, then it got cancelled....
I like to come into the office so I can use the gym anyway
It's only a 15 minute drive from my home
I'll probably go home after my workout
Which I might do in a few mins
Have you put that pcpartpicker build together yet?
What?
What are you talking about? What is jammy?
??????????
lmao I'm alone in the office
Gonna clean my protein shaker then go home I think
wtf
Oh good, there's a new version of Open Hardware Monitor
haha same
I know someone at work who plays games but he's a filthy casual so I unfriended him on Steam
wtf is westworld
Westworld looks pretty god
It's got Morpheus and that evil old man guy
Fuck I've got too much TV to watch
I don't have the time
I wish I didn't have a job, so I could watch more TV
Yeah him
I thought he was morpheus
Like GoT then?
I hate shows with too much boring character development
Do you like Open Hardware Monitor?
Did you know that Donald Trump has promised to speed up the rate of global warming?
impossible to speed up something that doesnt exist
If we get enough global warming, I won't have to scrape the ice off my car
Fuck, my co workers says that there are mistakes with the conditional formatting, so we're going back to changing formatting manually when dates expire and things....
I'm not allowed to apply conditional formatting in case anything ever gets changed to the wrong colour by mistake....
Told to remove all the formatting rules instead of just editing them
I didn't remove the default formatting, so when it changes to something where the rule doesn't apply, it goes back to whatever the cell was manually formatted to a while ago
So it was manually coloured green, I set the conditional rule up which also set it to green, then the cell value changed so the rule didn't apply, but it stayed green instead of going blank
Now I'm told that instead of fixing it, I have to remove it all
Which is a pain because now I'm going to have to manually change the cell colours all day
What do you mean by "flatten it"?
Damn the formula required for this spreadsheet is starting to get complicated, look at this shit =IF(OR(ISBLANK(VLOOKUP(A63,Planned!B:W,3,FALSE)),OR(VLOOKUP(A63,Planned!B:W,3,FALSE)="")),"",VLOOKUP(A63,Planned!B:W,3,FALSE))
I look at it and it makes me confused
IDK what's an absolute references?
Is there a way to write Excel formula that's easier than just writing it like it's just one line?
Like some sort of formula writer tool
Which puts parts into lines and has colours and stuff
Yeah that's what I've done before. It's so fucking difficult to put multiple formulas into just one at time of creation
I want to create mega formulas easily
How do I create a column containing the values of four different columns?
Like as a list
IDK man Japan is fucking weird
Yeah like aggregating 4 lists into one big list
Yeah
I did =INDEX(Planned!B:B,,1)
But now I want =INDEX(Response!B:B,,1) too
IDK how to merge them
Na they're on seperate sheets, which makes it a fucking pain
yeah I've put them all in a table now
Gonna do that
I should do this? http://www.get-digital-help.com/2009/06/29/merge-two-columns-into-one-list-in-excel/
It's not urgent work
Okay so I've done this =IF(ROW()<=COUNTA(V:V), INDEX(V:V,ROW()), IF(ROW()>COUNTA(V:W), "", INDEX(W:W,ROW()-COUNTA(V:V))))
But I want to add 3 more columns
That sounds hard
How quickly would low effort get me fired?
You said it would take a "good while"
But how long is a "good while"?
A week?
I'm actually pretty surprised I haven't been fired yet
I just spend all day on IRC and Reddit
Have you done whatever you're doing with that website yet?
Sorry m9
It's the best resource for esports results AFAIK
wtf are player performance stats
Oh wow you have to do this if the thing you're vlookingup isn't in the leftmost column https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2014/08/13/excel-index-match-function-vlookup/#lookup-values-left
So weird
God I have to do so many workarounds because this workbook is made so badly
I have used it now
Why can't vlookup just work even if the lookup value isn't on the left wtf
We don't at my workplace
It's not my spreadsheet, I'm just trying to make it less shit
Most people who use Excel don't actually know how to use it other than typing in data it seems....
It's barely any different than a large table to these people
when I started, my co worker just input data manually and changed formatting manually and copied and pasted data to produce reports and stuff
Yeah and recruitment agencies told me they won't give me any interviews because I didn't have any Excel experience
So IDK how these people are getting jobs
I watched Westworld at the weekend
Was pretty good, but I hope they don't do too much boring character development
Is that man that got captured and didn't get saved by his friend going to die?
I thought guests couldn't be killed, but they get beaten and knocked out a lot it seems
In the show
How do bullets penetrate androids but not humans?
Laser pointers with explosives implanted in the androids?
It doesn't make sense
Electronic switches
You turn off the bullet electronically
So guests can shoot guests?
That sounds like a fuck up waiting to happen
You're assuming the bullet is a chunk of metal which will do physical damage
What if it's an energy beam that can be switched off before it impacts?
What if it's an actual forcefield?
Which only works on projectiles travelling over 100mph
Occams Razor, guns fired by guests have the same effect as guns fired by hosts
So either there's a forcefield, or the gun is smart and just fires a blank
No wait, a guest said he felt something
Occams Razor. The guns are probably normal
The guests just have anti-bullet forcefields
Yes
It's in the future
So the hosts can still stab guests then?
Or run them over
Or make their own guns or tamper with the guns so they can shoot guests
What's a nuclear family?
Is that where you don't have step parents and step siblings?
Because now I have twice as many presents to buy :(
fuck
Can't buy a house because I'm spending all my money on fucking presents constantly
Why not?
omg my work is doing an online spot the difference competition
All I have to do is put the two pictures into a diff checkerer
fffs the snowglobe is aligned *slightly* off compared to the second image, but IDK if that's intentional or not
So basically whatever answer I give I'm wrong
the rules are ambigious as fuck too
They can basically take any answer and consider it wrong
But I want to win lots of shit
It's not the same if I don't deserve it
Hmmm maybe the second image was misaligned intentionally to throw off diff checkers
Fun is good
More time playing video games and less time doing work
Why are you unsure if that's a good thing lmao
HansProleman
the recruiter was really keen to impress on me how 'fun' the IT team at this place are
david brent lmao
That's bad, right?
Do a Mumble interview, it's better sound quality than Skype
Steam is pretty good nowadays too
Make sure you both have Blue Yetis
Do you drive?
A car isn't an investment lmao
where the fuck do you live that a bus is only £14 a week
What about all the time you lose waiting for the bus too?
Busses have fixed schedules and they also don't stick to them!!!!
I waited 90 minutes for a bus to get to the job centre once
I lost my benefits because the bus company fucked up
Some jobs require you to have a car
My contract says I must have my own transport
What if you want to go to Brighton?
Holy shit episode 7 is freaky

Yeah but haven't had the time recently
Been busy playing Dota, watching Westworld, etc
gf too
She takes up my time
Also, no Halloween skins now :(
fuck sake my internet connection died mid-call
Fucking frustrating
Do you have a gym at your workplace?
I love my office gym, I'd hate to lose it if I get another job

I think they're only ~21" screens too
I have a third screen, but only two screens work at a time....
I don't think he does

haha I pirate windoze too
wtf
your a pedo
wtf why?
Oh fuck sake, I have to entertain my gf from 23rd - 28th
She's so needy
But she's really fit
That's the important hting
My microphone stopped working. The card inside the box says "PLEASE DO NOT RETURN TO RETAILER" so I called Amazon for a replacement
Am I a bad person?
Phone calls and VoIP
It's weird how the website sometimes say I can't return an item, then I call them and they process the return
"I'm sorry to hear that you received your 'V-MODA BoomPro Gaming/VoIP Headphone with Microphone - Black' in that condition."
Well that's not what I said
I said it was working fine then it stopped
Blue Yeti is better for professional recording than gaming
It's not as close to your mouth, so it picks up noisy mechanical keyboards
It also takes up space on the desk
I don't even need that level of sound quality for a mic anyway
It's more for streamers and youtubers
Content creators, not gamers
Actually, you get flamed pretty hard for not having a mic in CS:GO
I know people have refused to play with me when my mic wasn't working
?
What kind of Asian is she?
You said she's your waifu
I wasn't
How old are you?
You married quite young then
nice
She's like your servant then
She's Korean
Did you know that even if Amazon's website doesn't let you return an item, you can phone their call centre and they will process a return for you
lmao
A dumbbell set is fucking heavy
It's like the weight of a piece of furniture compressed into a box
Wouldn't it make more sense to put the microwave on top of the dumbbells?
Sounds like whoever did the stacking is bad at their job
Or lazy/made a dumb mistake
hey
Where can I get a Audio-Technica ATH-AD700X with a removeable cable?
The AD700X?
What do you think of them?
Sounds like a good combination
Do you ever use your AD700 for gaming?
And a blue yeti mic?
Do you find your mic picks up the sound of your mechanical keyboard and your open headphones?
Need more details
I don't like how you can't use the funds to buy a house until >1 year after opening
I mean, I need details of the products themselves
I read the government announcement months ago
Not really, I can't see the benefits for me
A good company pension is better
It will replace the Help to Buy ISA, but I'll probably be buying sooner than I'll be eligible for the Lifetime ISA funds
What?
I mean if you have the choice to either put funds in a lifetime ISA or your company pension, your company pension is a better option
The lifetime ISA will be for first time buyers looking to buy >1 year from now
I might look into the Lifetime S&S ISA when I'm in my 40s and want to do a quick boost to my pension
But right now, I don't think it's for me
It's for 18 year olds who will buy in their 20s
Is it like Watergate or Gamergate?
wtf is this?
I'm on /r/pizzagate and I still can't figure out what this is about
wtf Donald Trump is a paedo?

The problem with Tinder is that you can't filter by race
Okcupid is better
It's free AFAIK
I was so financially fucked at uni. I got the minimum student loan amount because I lived with my rich step parent.
Poorer students got literally thousands £ more than me
My mum is asking me what I want for my birthday, what should I tell her?
I just put the stock M50X pads back on, and I can confirm that the isolation is still shit compared to my COPs
You're just comparing the isolation to your AD700s lmao
You have had the M50X, rory has had the DT770s, but only I have had both
And I can confidently say that the Beyers are superior in terms of comfort, sound quality and isolation
The M50X just wins out on portability, and only a little bit
Really?
Why didn't you keep them?
Oh it's the old one without the removeable cable
Why did you get DT770s instead of the M50X then?
I like kpop
Wanna buy my M50X? I've barely even used them
Got some spare velour earpads for extra comfort too
Hmmmm I think the noise isolation is okay, but it's the sound leakage which is the real problem with the M50X
Because people at work can hear my music
It's annoying when you can hear other peoples' music
There is no damage anywhere
Just test it yourself, sit next to people with your DT770s and M50Xs, play music, and ask them which pair they can hear sound from
wtf Hotmail adds deliveries to my calendar when Amazon emails me now
?
I still have an account, but I haven't change my email address to my openmailbox on amazon yet
I'm a bit lazy to change my email address on every website I have an account for
I don't want to set up email forwarding either, because my Hotmail gets a lot of spam....
I'll slowly change all my emails over the next couple of years
Which of these two fans would perform best for my 240mm AIO? https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01G5I6MRK/ https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00IEOD45W/

Want to buy my like-new M50X?
Good luck trying to time the market

DAT FUCKING TWIST OMFG
I can read, I just choose not to
Amazon are incredible. I got my new mic in less than 24 hours
I like how I get a brand new warranty if I get a replacement from Amazon too
Even though the manufacturer wants me to return to them, Amazon return policy is too good to ignore
That Westworld twist made me so excited
Did you enjoy the twist too?
I got goosebumps when Bernard said "it doesn't look like anything to me"
Oh shit sorry
My bad
Please nobody talk about Star Wars and Harry Potter, because I haven't watched those yet
Jokes on you, I will forget that by the time I watch it
It's amazing how many requests I get to reset the password of the same people every week
IDK why they can't just remember their fucking password or use Lastpass or something
yeah lmao
I don't mind doing it, doesn't take too much of my time and they are always thankful for it. It's just weird how it's always the same people
Congrats
Hello
Do you watch Westworld?
wtf
I'm upset that I still don't own a pair of Fidelio X2s :(
One day
Hey my birthday is coming up, and I really want a pair of Fidelio X2s
Probably
Ultrawides can't quite replace dual monitors yet IMO
The resolution, response time and refresh rate aren't quite there
Also the fact that Overwatch doesn't support ultrawides properly pisses me off
ffs I keep forgetting the names of all the peopl eI work with
I'm trying to remember the name of a woman
No I don't
I work at a pretty big company
Yeah
lmao I discovered yesterday that I had plugged my pump into the CPU fan header and the radiator fans into the system fan header
I had to switch them last night, and now my PC is so quiet
IDK how I didn't notice earlier
I was trying to figure out why I couldn't control the fan speed properly
You can't really go quieter unless you get a fucking massive heatsink mounted directly onto the motherboard
The pump noise isn't too bad, it just raises the potential noise floor a bit
So you can never go really silent
But I don't mind a little bit of mechanical hum
I quite like it actually, because it's like a quiet white noise machine
It's my air purifier, white noise machine and gaming PC
It's a really really good case
The amount of possible hardware combinations you can put in such a small case is amazing
The only thing I don't like about it is the cost, because it makes it harder to keep the value of my PC below £1000, which means I need to declare it on my contents insurance
I also really like tool-less cases, but I can see why they used traditional screws to save space
It's not the easiest case to just casually open up and tweak
And it requires some planning to build around, but the end result is an exceptional performance:size ratio
It captures lots of dust in the intakes, so it's pretty much an air purifier, right?
I used to do that years ago when I had a shit case
A good case doesn't have that problem though
Since I like small form factor cases, I usually go for reference cards which draw fresh air from outside the case then blow them back out of the case
The graphics cards with 2/3 large fans are only ever good if you have a very large case with very good ventilation
I might get a hybrid card later on, which are a good compromise between reference and aftermarket coolers
So you get a traditional reference fan design, but a AIO water cooler as well
The only problem with that is that I'd probably have to give up my 240mm rad and get a 120mm for my CPU instead
It sounds like the problem he has is that the graphics card draws all the hot air directly into the case instead of blowing it out the back, and his case doesn't have the airflow to deal with it
Why?
Got pics?
I doubt I'd be shocked, I didn't dust my PC once for like 2 years and it was fucking disgusting inside, I could grab big lumps of dust
Get a can of compressed air and blow it out
Make sure your PC is elevated off the ground, put it on your desk if you can
And use dust filters
At least your PSU hasn't caught fire like mine did
It was a shitty OEM cooler and couldn't survive all the abuse I gave it
s/cooler/PSU/
Yeah, I always recommend getting a good PSU now
I used the PSU from a pre-built from PCworld, then upgraded the graphics card, never dusted it for years, then it caught fire....
That PC was overdue an upgrade, so I built a completely new machine a few months later
I actually still used IDE drives up until last year, I reused 10 year old ones
I only had enough money to build a seriously good machine last year when I sold my old one
IDE optical drives
Yeah I never really used them
I think at the time I built my new PC, I bought one of the last remaining IDE motherboards
There was only one board which supported the new Intel CPUs and IDE drives so I could reuse my old ones
My new Ncase M1 build doesn't have an optical drive, but I could put one in if I wanted
I just don't need to use optical discs any more
Yeah I use USB sticks and internet for everything I used to use optical discs for
ffs I wish my fucking co-worker would stop changing the lookup names in the spreadsheet
She's adding in comments into cells randomly and it breaks all the formula
Fucking hell
A vlookup doesn't work when you change the lookup names every fucking day omg
omggggggggggggggggg
Yeah
The things in the left column
Or *should* be in the left
She has no idea how to use Excel other than as a table of data
Yeah I thought about doing an index of the values then doing vlookup on that
But I have to index from 5 sheets, and it's hard....
What about a list of values from a column from 5 sheets?
Fuck my work is so busy right now
I want to buy a GTX 1080 but I can't justify the cost
I also want a 6700K but Kaby Lake is coming out soon
And I should wait for Zen too
I also need a 240hz monitor
wtf is with your creepy obsession with my gf?
Are you really that creepy that you can't get a date without my help even though you live in a city with thousands of beautiful girls?
Nice exaggeration m9
Are you gay?
Okay that's it I'm putting you on ignore and focusing on my work
The only thing I don't like about having a gf is that I can't meet lots of new girls
What?
Do you think anything will come to replace What.cd like with Oink?
There's lots of azn grills in all UK cities now, I love it!
Can you let me know when something does pls?
Thanks
wtf why have the conditional formatting rules duplicated itself a hundred times?
What website?
My gf is sooooooooooooo much prettier than HansProleman's
I'm so lucky to have such a smoking hot gf
When my weight started going up above optimum levels, I took preventative action to stop it from becoming dangerous. A responsible person tackles health issues before they even become a problem.
My first office job was such a shock to me; never before had to sat on my arse for so long and had such a big supply of cake and biscuits
I gained 3 stones in less than a year
So I lost 3 stones earlier this year to bring my weight back in check
Losing weight is easy, all you have to do is regularly exercise and consume less calories
IDK why there are so many fucking fat people; my workplace has an obesity rate of about 75%
Have you spoken to a psychiatrist about it?
Incentivising unhealthy lifestyles has a number of health implications including joint problems, cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Racial diversity is not an unhealthy thing to promote.
In fact, genetic diversity is very good for the health of offspring
Small boobies is very healthy
Less risk of breast cancer, less risk of back problems, etc
You're very vein if breast size is important to your choice of mate
My gf has so many redeeming features that her small boobies are not an issue
Shallow, vein, it's the same thing
Maybe they're opposites
You seem to care a lot about physical things
I meant shallow then
Na, I am not material like you
I bet my gf and gaming rig are smaller than yours
A+?
A+ is small
What are the specs of your rig?
I know some people with custom watercooling loops but it just seems like overkill to me
What case?
What CPU is it?
GTX 960 isn't bad
4690K, cool the same CPU as mine
That's not a bad PC you've got
Have you OCed your CPU at all?
You could probably get your CPU up to 4.4/4.5GHz with that
I want to get an i7 at some point; Overwatch performs so much better with i7s
I thought i5 would be enough because Dota 2 and CS:GO didn't benefit from HT
But now OW is out and I struggle to get more than 200FPS :(
Just buy the game you cheapskate
Should I make an offer for this flat? http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-54461956.html
Yeah kinda weird
The washing machine is in the wrong place
I need to get a oven with a hob and place it where the washing machine is
It has a double bed, so I just need a double mattress, then I can invite my gf over for sex!
What do you mean?
I made an offer on a flat this morning
I might be a landlord soon omfg
"I delete my temp files every month because it helps keep my computer fast"
Surely it would be the opposite?
Now her system needs to cache everything again
My offer was rejected
I didn't mean landlord actually
I thought I could be a landlord without renting out the property
But I guess I'll just be a homeowner :(
Landlord sounds cooler
Exactly
I'll be lord of the land
Don't let your dreams be memes
Should I buy this house? http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-45593745.html
I adjusted the fan curves so my PC is really quiet now
I never understood why debt is bad anyway
Debt just means the money is worth more now than it is later
What has household debt got to do with government debt?
You're confusing me
As long as the government keeps the deficit within 60% and the budget deficit within 3% to stay compliant with EU regulation, we should be fine
Or just leave the EU and triple the debt IDK
wtf
Yeah isn't that what I just said?
What do you think of this house? http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-45593745.html
Would the outside repainting be a priority? I'd rather not do it before I need it revalued or sold
I'd rather do the important stuff like plumbing/heating/damp/mould before any cosmetic stuff
Yeah I don't mind if my house *looks* like shit
I'd just rather it not be actual shit
Yeah of course, that's pretty important
I just need the house to function properly, and I'll make it look nice when I have to or can afford to
There's no EPC yet
I think it'll do okay, probably a C
It's fairly small
N.B. Please note that on this occasion we have not been able to verify any details with the previous owner.We therefore advise a prospective purchaser to make their own enquiries through their solicitor and surveyor. EPC and floor plan will follow. These are temporary photographs.
N B = New Build?
My fucking bedroom gets too hot in the summer because of my gaming PC :(
I have a big 240mm radiator and high-end GPU, so it kicks out a lot of heat....
Good for the winter though
Well even if you're paying for the electricity, you get a gaming PC, electric heater, and air purifier with just one device
Just imagine the interviewers are fat and naked
"most people"
hahahaha
Why don't you want to imagine them fat and naked?
I want to go for a job interview where the interviewer is an azn grill
Can I come too?
Fuck sake the house is sold already
Only came onto the market last night
Yeah, I like kpop that's a few years old now
Classics like SNSD Gee and T-ara's first album
Have you ever considered getting a dog?
Yeah but they're cooler
Why are you leaving?
Didn't you already do that?
If I spoke Chinese, I would move permanently to Shanghai
Soooooooooooooo many azn grills in Shanghai
What's the difference?
What will you do with your gaming PC?
Can I have it?
Do you have travel insurance? You can save money by getting in shape first, so you're seen as lower risk
HansProleman Weight mostly
Travelling when overweight sounds like a bad idea to me
You'll be paying like £1,000 a month just to make sure you're covered if you have a heart attack
It will be if you're really fucking fat
Also, you will have to buy two seats....
I've seen pics
You will need to buy a second plane seat
Your weird sexual fetish is really unhealthy man
Yeah it might give me diabetes and heart disease!!!
Maybe upgrade your gaming PC?
Maybe OC your CPU
Maybe go home
Maybe go to the pet shop and pet some puppies
Many taxpayers are struggling?
Or many homeless are struggling?
Homeless people aren't taxpayers now?
VAT
Income tax
They rent shop doors

Wanna buy my M50X?
Good headphones will hold its value in UK

My M50X are in like-new condition
I've barely used them because I prefer my beyers

Hey
Want to buy M50X?
It's consumer electronic

My gut feeling tells me that's a bad idea
When I gave her my username and password to my student discount account she stole my KFC discount and I couldn't claim my chicken stamps

IDK I've only just signed up too
I don't really need a budget
I just need to keep track of my savings
I'm calculating I'm earning 9.79% interest on my savings ATM
But that will drop below 9% in a week
I'm getting as good as I can get whilst keeping it 100% liquid
Yeah I might use the tagging stuff to help me budget when I move
Yeah but it's such a small amount of savings
I'm having a hard time because my gf is pushing me to buy a house really soon
I asked her if she wanted to rent, and she said only if I pay for it all
And that would kill my chances of buying a flat
Oh cool
Oh that's so useful
lmao same
It's too predictive based on the past....
It thinks I'm going to withdraw some money from the wedding venue last month...
There's a Cashflow Planner
Set that up
I spent £20 at a wedding venue last month, and it thinks I'll do it again this month
But obviously not
Visiting another office
How are you today
omg the light went out whilst I was pooing
And then I blocked the toilet
HansProleman:
I jsut went for a poo in the new office
The light went out when I was pooping so I used my phone
Then I blocked the toilet
I drank lots of coffee and held it in from last night because there was no toilet paper, then today because I had meetings
I've been busy
My mum buys them all
Meetings
I met the new starter
wtf
She's Governance
I'm at a big company
No
More like >1000
Yes.
If it was on FTSE it'd be Fortune 500 probably
I'll PM you later
Why?
Oh right
That's just going to increase rents anyway
Does that mean the cash buyers trying to steal my flat from me will not want it any more?
Damn
I'm going to WFH now I think
Got a bit of a drive home
It would be good to go now rather than later

It's interesting to watch my co-worker guess development time

If not, then CBA
Black Friday sucks because they only sell shit products
Yeah what Bulwark said
I already know what I want, I'm just waiting for the products to go on sale
haha my co-worker says she doesn't mind violence if it's against men
yay I just got paid and now I have £ 14,743.75
I'd recommend waiting for the upcoming 240hz displays
There's a few coming in the next few months
Ah
Well it depends what he needs it for. Casual gaming, films, office?
Competitive gaming?
An ultrawide would be pretty great for casual gaming IMO
Or a 144hz gsync
144hz adaptive sync
What's the budget?
Ultrawides might be too expensive
They're pretty awesome though
Okay definitely not an ultrawide then
I'd recommend a second hand 144hz adaptive sync from ebay
Or Amazon marketplace
Don't go for a standard 144hz without adaptive sync because it'll be pointless at 80FPS
Also, make sure it's compatible with his GPU
ATI cards need Freesync displays and nVidia need Gsync
A bit overbudget but looks good value https://www.amazon.co.uk/ViewSonic-XG2401-Monitor-FreeSync-DisplayPort/dp/B01A0ZRR50/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480075713&sr=8-1&keywords=freesync+144
Can he stretch to £190?>
If not, I don't think he can get a 144hz adaptive sync
In which case I'm recommend just getting the cheapest 1080p monitor he can find until he can afford something decent
Link him that display
Be fast about it, the flash sale will end soon
If he has an ATI GPU, then that monitor would be great for him
Perfect casual gaming monitor
It usually sells for around £250
R9 390 is a pretty good card
And a good pairing with that monitor
IDK why he spent so much on a GPU and cheaping out on the monitor though
I bet he has a shitty CPU too
lmao that's a bad CPU
Why did he buy that such bad CPU?
The single-threaded speed is so bad
It gets outperformed by dual core Intels

I think I saw one of my accounts was updated in the middle of the night
So it must have done it by itself?
I like how I can keep track of all my bank accounts from one website rather than logging into all my banks individually and entering all the fucking login information each time
It's just so much more convenient this way
IDK why I'm still not getting my Halifax and Co-Op monthly rewards
How many accounts have you registered with it?
I've put multiple FD, TSB, Nationwide, Halifax, Co-Op, Tesco, etc
I like how the BBC is pushing the agenda that gamers are sexist now
haha no, they will just edit it to fit their agenda if they can
They just did it...
One of the pros complained that they edited her interview to make it seem like they supported the BBC agenda

Yeah you can, Google it

Is this a good deal? Should I buy it? https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/black-friday-2016
Or this one? https://store.cyberghostvpn.com/848/surl-VhXlvehZJJ
I have PIA now
I have PIA
Private Internet Access omg
fuck sake no sale yet https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00MRUPSHQ/
Why the fuck is nothing I want getting Black Friday
And where are all the Black Friday one bedroom flats?!?!?!
Well yeah, I don't buy shit
If I stream to Chromecast from my PC, will the VPN work>
I don't want letters from my ISP
What VPN do you use?
wow that sucks
wtf
I was thinking Chromecast could be used just to receive video from my PC
Chromecast has a torrent client then?
Stremio supports Chromecast
So will it stream to Chromecast using my PC's connection?
So Chromecast CAN be used just as a receiver?
I will do all my torrenting through my VPN so I don't get harassed by ISP, police, media companies, etc
I'd rather pay for a VPN to use Stremio than pay for Netflix lmao
Just VPN
IDK why I'd need a seedbox
PIA bought it yesterday for $29
It'll renew next year for $29
That's only $2.42 a month
PIA is a VPN
It's the name of the service
It's got a shitload of servers, lets you use up to 5 devices per subscription, and has a killswitch
It seems like one of the best ones, but I've heard good things about Cyberghost which is only £15 atm
I've even been gaming on this VPN
You can get Hoxx for Firefox for browsing
Or use Opera's built in one
Or try Tor Browser
I guess so
All these cyber deals are shit
The only good things are the VPNs
Oh this looks pretty fucking good https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crucial-MX300-Internal-Solid-Adapter/dp/B01IAGSD68/
I like KFC because I have a 15% student discount
My BMI is fine
Do you like the Big Daddy meal?
What do you mean by "a crappy piece"?
Really?
What's bad about the crappy pieces then?
Are you going to be filthy rich like rory?
Amazon are delivering parcels to my mum, I wonder if any of those are stuff from my wishlist
I want the webcam, DT770 pads, headphone case, and PC case fans
I'm faster than most others Bulwark
My cursor speed is very high
lmao you still use scart?
wtf the wii uses scart?
scart is fucking ancient
It's okay, you can return the product to Amazon within 30 days
I'm not sure if smart TVs are a good idea, you can't upgrade/modify it like you can with a standard TV with USB ports
I think it's better if a display is just a display
You can build a better PC at the same cost of a console anyway
And if you already have a semi-decent PC, you can just stick a graphics card inside it
An office PC with an ATI 460 will shit all over any console
As long as the office PC was made in the last 5 years or so
I know there's still a lot of businesses running 15 year old machines with Windoze XP *shudder*
I don't see the point
PC gaming is better
Consoles are for plebs
There's very little consoles do better than PCs nowadays
And a shitload of things PCs do better than consoles, and growing
I'm really enjoying PIA, it gives me peace of mind that the BPI and MFAA and GCHQ and Teresa May aren't all watching everything I'm doing
Yeah
Seemed like a safe one to go for
It's working very well
I couldn't use my Amazon gift card though :(
I have £10 Amazon credit from my cancelled Fidelio X2s
Who the fuck has Starbucks gift cards anyway
Hmmmm my gf would probably like that
I paid using my credit card, is that going to be a problem?
That could happen if I torrent too much...
wtf
Ah I'm not really into any of that stuff
What stuff is covered under etc?
If I call someone a bitch on Facebook are the government going to try to arrest me for internet trolling harassment?
What if the government think I am a nuisance?
Don't 100% of ISPs give up the details because it's requested by the court?
Will my ISP protect me from all the spying laws the UK government is putting into place?

wtf but I have a vpn
Wanna play Battlerite with me and Bulwark?
It's like LoL but less shit
Work is boring, play Battlerite instead
I'd say some of Dota's custom game modes are the best teamfights
You don't really need Battlerite when you have Dota
You would prefer to stay in your rut than trying something new?
I'm sure this 7700K GTX 1080 you want me to build for you will handle Runescape just fine lmao
Why did your Roonscape get banned?
omg your such a filthy casual
wtf kind of bullshit is this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-_m4shOmkY
That fucking question wtf
Hillary Clinton isn't any better lmao
You're acting like there are other options
The only two options you get are awful, so you can't go wrong whichever way you vote

wtf someone stole my Qck+ mousepad

wtf what kind of fucking small company is that
Do you have to do much work?
Is Pizzagate a hoax?
RIP Brazillian football team
lmao I love how the headlines try to mislead people into thinking it's the national team
And the headlines make it sound like the whole team died too
So basically just some random footballers died
Yeah famous people need to get around a lot
A lot more motorbike owners die in motorbike crashes than you too
What do you mean?
I don't watch anime
I'm not a NEET like you
your an idiot
Sure if you define your entire self worth by how much salary you currently get
People like you are why there's a suicide epidemic amongst the unemployed
People like you are why there's a diabetes epidemic among the poor
I have multiple good headsets
I am in England
I built them myself
V-Moda Boompro FTW
I like my AKG K702 + Boompro
And COP + Boompro
Hey wanna buy my M50X?

My flat :(
?
wat?
Okay well it turns out that Amazon tells me what my mum has bought me from my wishlist
And it turns out my mum bought it for £60 when it's £30 now
Should I buy it for £30 and return the one she bought?
Or at least I think she bought it for £60
It was £60 when she bought it on 26th November
wtf are you talking about?
Because it's marked as "purchased" on my wishlist

Oh shit they're running PC Audit Pro on my work laptop
I installed lots of software I shouldn't have
F.lux
Chrome
Opera
It's against the IT policy to install software without permission
I justcouldn't be arsed to ask
?
What do you mean?
That's what I thought lmao
wtf why does my work block PIA VPN?!?!?
Should an ampersand be at the bottom alphabetically or the top?
Why does Excel let me sort alphabetically then?
thanks
Why doesn't my PIA VPN work at work?
Why would they do that?
